    "This is a story of boy meets girl.",
    "The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his... \"soulmate.\"",
    "This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, \"The Graduate.\"",
    "The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief.",
    "Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair.",
    "The second was how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing.",
    "Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for.",
    "This is a story of boy meets girl.",
    "You should know up front, this is not a love story.",
    "I didn't know who else to call.",
    "You did the right thing. Where is he?",
    "Thomas.",
    "Rachel? What are you doing here?",
    "I'm here to help you.",
    "Help me how?",
    "First, put down the plate.",
    "Now come here and sit down.",
    "The key is not to panic.",
    "I think I'm gonna be sick.",
    "Drink this.",
    "What is that?",
    "Vodka.",
    "More.",
    "Does Mom know you're here? It's gotta be past 10.",
    "Don't worry about it. Start from the beginning. Tell us what happened...",
    "We spent the whole day together.",
    "We went shopping.",
    "We had coffee.",
    "We saw a film.",
    "We bought music.",
    "I thought it was a great day.",
    "And then what happened?",
    "Um...you know what...let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH. God, I love eating pancakes at night. It's like the greatest thing ever. How great is this?",
    "I think we should stop seeing each other.",
    "Just like that?",
    "Just like that.",
    "Did she say why?",
    "This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is normal?",
    "I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy?",
    "You're happy?",
    "You're not?",
    "All we do is argue!",
    "That is such a lie!",
    "Maybe she was just in a bad mood.",
    "A hormonal thing.",
    "P.M.S.?",
    "What do you know about PMS?",
    "More than you.",
    "Oh my god.",
    "Please continue.",
    "This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months.",
    "Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.",
    "No... I'm Sid.",
    "So I'm Nancy?!",
    "Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving.",
    "Mmm, you're so right. These are great!",
    "What?",
    "Tom, don't. Come back. You're still my best fr---",
    "Jesus.",
    "That's harsh.",
    "I don't know what I'm gonna do.",
    "You're gonna be fine.",
    "I'm gonna throw up.",
    "Or that.",
    "Here.",
    "Come on Hansen. You'll be ok. You're the best guy I know. You'll find someone.",
    "You know what they say...there's plenty other fish in the sea.",
    "No.",
    "Sure they do. They say that.",
    "Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman! Sorry. What I mean is... there are no other fish. This was my fish.",
    "I'm in love with Summer.",
    "For real?",
    "I love her smile.",
    "I love her hair.",
    "I love her knees.",
    "I love how one eye is higher up on her face than the other eye.",
    "I love the scar on her neck from this operation she had as a kid.",
    "I love how she looks in my Clash T- shirt.",
    "I love how she looks when she's sleeping.",
    "I love the sound of her laugh.",
    "I love how I hear this song every time I think of her.",
    "I love how she makes me feel. Like anything's possible. Like, I don't know...like life is worth it.",
    "For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl.",
    "Oh shit.",
    "Now I know this may be a little risque...but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that.",
    "May 21st. Other Mother's Day.",
    "Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's \"Magellan Day\" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these?",
    "Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a call for you on line 3.",
    "Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from...",
    "Michigan.",
    "Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this.",
    "Nice to meet you all.",
    "What do we know about this new girl?",
    "Who?",
    "The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office.",
    "Dude. I hear she's a bitch from hell!",
    "Really?",
    "Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.",
    "Maybe she was just in a hurry.",
    "And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank.",
    "Damn.",
    "I know. She's pretty hot.",
    "That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it?",
    "Dunno.",
    "Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin...",
    "...and really good teeth.",
    "And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe?",
    "Women.",
    "Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already.",
    "The Smiths.",
    "I love The Smiths.",
    "Sorry?",
    "I said. I love The Smiths. You have good taste in music.",
    "You like the Smiths?",
    "\"To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die.\" Love it.",
    "Oh my god.",
    "Hi.",
    "Hello.",
    "So, uh, Summer...",
    "Tom.",
    "Yeah! How's it going so far?",
    "The city or the firm?",
    "Both... Either.",
    "I'm happy. Still getting situated. How long have you worked here?",
    "Why thank you. That's what they called me in college. \"Perfectly adequate\" Hansen.",
    "They used to call me \"Anal Girl.\"",
    "I was very neat and organized.",
    "Anyway, I should get back.",
    "Ok, well, I'll see you around.",
    "And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper.",
    "Your favorites.",
    "We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing.",
    "Oh boy.",
    "What?",
    "You know...just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her \"the one.\"",
    "Of course it does.",
    "Dinner!",
    "Pause and come eat.",
    "Hey Martin.",
    "He met a girl.",
    "Yeah?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Oh shit.",
    "When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds.",
    "Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of \"true love.\" The evidence did not support him.",
    "Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner.",
    "Exhibit B: Wendy Wilson.",
    "I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome.",
    "Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles.",
    "And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever!",
    "I think we should see other people.",
    "And, finally... Exhibit D: Amanda Heller.",
    "It's just... it's complicated.",
    "What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me!",
    "I know it's sudden but...",
    "No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand.",
    "Here.",
    "What's this?",
    "Because you're, like, the biggest music nerd I've ever met, I think this should really help explain where I'm coming from.",
    "You remember how much I loved this song when you first played it for me?",
    "Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks.",
    "Right. And I still like it, don't get me wrong. It's just... When I hear it now, I don't feel the same...rush.",
    "Ok...",
    "I press the skip button.",
    "What does this have to do with--?",
    "I'd rather listen to something else.",
    "But Amanda... this is a great fucking song!",
    "It's off.",
    "What?",
    "Me and Summer.",
    "Was it ever on?",
    "No. But it could have been. In a world where good things happen to me.",
    "Yeah well, that's not really where we live.",
    "No.",
    "So what happened?",
    "You ready for this?",
    "So there we are. All alone. Nine more floors to ride. Plenty of time. I figure...this is my chance. If not now when, right?",
    "Summer...",
    "Yeah?",
    "So how was your weekend?",
    "It was good.",
    "You believe that shit?",
    "What shit?",
    "I think I missed something.",
    "\"It was good.\" She didn't say \"It was good.\" She said \"It was good.\" Emphasis on the good. She basically said \"I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym.\" Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over.",
    "What the hell is wrong with you?!",
    "Dude, you got problems.",
    "She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do.",
    "Based on...\"it was good?\"",
    "And some other things.",
    "Like what, she said \"hey\" instead of \"hi\" cause that totally means she's a lesbian.",
    "I gave her all sorts of chances.",
    "I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything?",
    "No thanks.",
    "I think you know what I need.",
    "Toner.",
    "Oh ok, sure, no prob.",
    "Do you want to go out with me?",
    "And the Priest says, \"But we're already out!\"",
    "That is hilarious!",
    "I know!",
    "Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over.",
    "This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well.",
    "No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.",
    "Come on! \"Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties!\"",
    "They won't let you back in there after last time.",
    "I wasn't that bad.",
    "Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you.",
    "You saved my life that day.",
    "We are not going back there.",
    "This is a work thing, Tommy. It won't be like that. The whole office is going.",
    "I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of.",
    "You're not listening to me.",
    "What?",
    "The whole office is going.",
    "Hi.",
    "Hey! They said you weren't coming.",
    "You asked if I was coming? I mean...my plans got cancelled...",
    "Goddamn that song is brilliant! What's up Hansen?",
    "Ooh that's me.",
    "Ok. I'm the new girl so no making fun of me.",
    "You were great up there, by the way.",
    "Well you can't go wrong with The Boss.",
    "I hear that.",
    "Hey, did you know Tom here's from Jersey?",
    "Yeah?",
    "Lived there til I was 12.",
    "I named my cat after Springsteen.",
    "No kidding? What's his name?",
    "Bruce.",
    "That makes sense.",
    "So you got a boyfriend?",
    "Me? No.",
    "Why not?",
    "Don't really want one.",
    "Come on. I don't believe that.",
    "You don't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent?",
    "Are you a lesbian?",
    "No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not comfortable being somebody's \"girlfriend.\" I don't want to be anybody's anything, you know?",
    "I have no idea what you're talking about.",
    "It sounds selfish, I know, but... I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.",
    "I say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later.",
    "But...what if you meet someone and fall in love?",
    "Love? You seriously believe in that stuff?",
    "Of course I do.",
    "Interesting. A real romantic.",
    "Oh you have no idea. This one... embarrassing. There was this one girl, I gotta tell this story --",
    "Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love?",
    "I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents.",
    "Well mine too but --",
    "Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in \"love\" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?",
    "Well...",
    "Why, what's your take on it?",
    "I think it's...kind of a huge thing.",
    "Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.",
    "So, uh, who's singing next?",
    "I'd say it's your turn loverboy.",
    "Nooo. I don't sing in public.",
    "Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.",
    "I don't...",
    "You really do.",
    "It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous.",
    "Self-confidence! Ha!",
    "Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people.",
    "Ok then. Let's drink.",
    "It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.",
    "Bartender!",
    "That's not it.",
    "What is that then?",
    "I have no idea.",
    "I used to watch it every week.",
    "Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song.",
    "Pathetic.",
    "This is gonna bother me for weeks.",
    "Totally.",
    "\"And I'd proudly stand UP!\" I said stand!",
    "Oh here we go.",
    "This guy. He's the best.",
    "Ok, let's get you in a cab.",
    "No. I'm gonna walk. I live right down that street. Or that one.",
    "Is he gonna be ok?",
    "He'll be fine.",
    "Hey.",
    "What's up?",
    "Not you. You. He likes you.",
    "Ok, goodnight McKenzie!",
    "I mean... likes you, likes you. For real. Tell her Tom.",
    "Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't --",
    "Is that true?",
    "What?",
    "You know what. Do you...like me?",
    "Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.",
    "As a friend.",
    "Right. As a friend.",
    "Just as a friend?",
    "Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why?",
    "Nothing. I just... You're interesting. I'd like us to be friends. Is that ok?",
    "Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect.",
    "Cool.",
    "Cool.",
    "Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.",
    "G'night Summer.",
    "Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.",
    "Hey!",
    "Hey!",
    "Hey Mr. Vance.",
    "Yes, Mr. Vance?",
    "You son of a bitch.",
    "Last night, karaoke night?",
    "Shhh.",
    "The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now?",
    "I have not been...",
    "The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what. That girl?",
    "Paul, seriously...",
    "Did you bang her?",
    "No!",
    "Blow job?",
    "No!",
    "Hand job?",
    "No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed.",
    "Come on, level with me. As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, I mean you were practically stalking her...",
    "Shhh!",
    "Oh crap.",
    "Hi, I'm Summer..",
    "Summer, wow what an unusual name. I'm sure I'd remember that if I had heard it before. Tom, how come you've never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady? Or perhaps you have and I've just forgot. I mean, with all the women in Tom's life it's hard to keep track... Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul.",
    "Hi Paul.",
    "I'm a doctor.",
    "Nice to meet you.",
    "Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I was never here. Tom, talk to you later?... Hey, If any jobs open up...",
    "If you heard...",
    "Heard what?",
    "Excellent. You ready to go.",
    "I'm stalking, STARVING!",
    "He exaggerates!",
    "Check them out.",
    "That is hot.",
    "I am very turned on right now.",
    "Sometimes you can be so judgmental.",
    "Huh?",
    "I mean, who are you? They're happy. Just mind your own business.",
    "9, 9.5?",
    "Too soon to say. It's all in the dismount.",
    "If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount.",
    "I can't believe them. I have like zero patience for PDA.",
    "I hear ya. If I want to watch people make out, I have big windows and binoculars at home.",
    "Yeah?",
    "No. That would be wrong.",
    "This is fun. You're fun.",
    "Thanks.",
    "I mean, I just want to say, up front, I'm not looking for anything serious.",
    "Are you cool with that?",
    "Sure.",
    "It freaks some guys out when I say that.",
    "Not me.",
    "Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations. Ok?",
    "Sure.",
    "Wanna hold my hand under the table?",
    "Yeah.",
    "I'll be...back in a sec.",
    "Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself.",
    "Are you calm? Ok. Then it's time to go back in.",
    "Hi.",
    "Oh sweet Jesus!",
    "I fucking hate Summer.",
    "I hate her crooked teeth.",
    "I hate her 1950s haircut.",
    "I hate her knobby knees.",
    "I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head.",
    "I hate that centipede-shaped scar.",
    "I hate her...stupid...big boobs.",
    "I hate the way she sleeps.",
    "I hate the way she laughs.",
    "I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG!",
    "Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle.",
    "It's very... complex.",
    "Complex. Yes.",
    "In a way, it speaks so much by saying... so little.",
    "I feel the same way.",
    "You wanna go to the movies?",
    "God yes!",
    "A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.",
    "The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God.",
    "It just makes you feel... peaceful.",
    "No. See now, this is torture.",
    "Why?",
    "Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there.",
    "How would you change it?",
    "There's a million things. First, there's no need for this much glass. You could easily...",
    "Show me.",
    "What?",
    "Don't talk about it. Do it.",
    "See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so...",
    "You wanna --",
    "No you go first.",
    "It doesn't matter to me.",
    "Whatever you want.",
    "Hey./ Hi.",
    "So how's it going?",
    "Hello?",
    "I remember!",
    "That's it!",
    "Your girl is losing it.",
    "This is not at all as easy as it looks.",
    "Ow!",
    "There's no way.",
    "Why not?",
    "\"Octopus's Garden?\" You may as well just say \"Piggies?\"",
    "I told you. I love Ringo.",
    "You're insane.",
    "Why?",
    "Cause nobody loves Ringo.",
    "That's what I love about him. Ooh.",
    "This got great reviews.",
    "Is that... possible?",
    "So what's going on with you and Summer?",
    "I don't know.",
    "Is she your girlfriend?",
    "I wouldn't say that.",
    "What would you say?",
    "Like, are we \"going steady?\" Come on, guys. We're adults.",
    "It's not an unreasonable question. Watch. McKenzie, do you have a girlfriend?",
    "No I do not. In fact girls are repulsed by me. Paul, how about you?",
    "Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.",
    "It is when you've been with the same girl since high school.",
    "You've been \"seeing\" this girl, what, two months now?",
    "Something like that.",
    "And you haven't discussed it?",
    "No! She's not... We're not like that.",
    "Like what?",
    "Normal.",
    "We've just been... hanging out.",
    "Hanging out?!",
    "Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. \"Boyfriend, girlfriend.\" That stuff is very... juvenile.",
    "You're so gay.",
    "Well let me ask you this then. Do you want her to be your girlfriend?",
    "I don't know... Maybe.",
    "I heard her Hansen. She's not the girlfriend type. You're gonna need to discuss it.",
    "No. We're adults. It'll be fine.",
    "Have you made her a CD yet?",
    "Maybe.",
    "Oh dude.",
    "You really need to have that talk.",
    "You were saying?",
    "My thinking is... why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl \"I love you.\"",
    "I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean.",
    "Who the hell's Sean?",
    "My boyfriend before Mark.",
    "Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice.",
    "I'm 12.",
    "Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble.",
    "Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?",
    "Something like that.",
    "Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now... or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway?",
    "Who's Lars?",
    "He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.",
    "That son of a bitch.",
    "You see what I mean?",
    "Later dude.",
    "Coach, no, wait! I need her. Rachel, what do you think I should do?",
    "Just don't be a pussy.",
    "Hi.",
    "Hi.",
    "Are you ok?",
    "Yeah.",
    "You sure?",
    "Summer, I've gotta ask you something.",
    "Ok.",
    "Wait!",
    "Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful.",
    "\"So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?\"",
    "\"No you should not.\"",
    "\"Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill. Those steps are:\"",

    "I can't believe you.",
    "What?",
    "You were so completely uncool in there.",
    "You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.",

    "Well maybe you should think about... someone else... who could cheer you up.",
    "I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow?",

    "Waiter!",
    "Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with.",
    "How was your weekend?",
    "It was good.",
    "Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why.",

When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird?",

    "What? Why?",
    "I'm just really tired and I've gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead?",

    "I'm not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right?",
    "Sorta.",

    "Shit. That's not bad.",
    "No worries.",
    "This is good Millie. \"To my wife, the love of my life. I love you.\" That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... \"Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete.\" You know, spice it up a little.",

    "Ok.",
    "What do you mean?",

    "No.",

But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do.",
    "There's no fucking way!",

    "Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- workers --",
    "That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?",
    "Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!",
    "I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this... \"I'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed.\" What the hell? Let's give em some truth. Something like, \"Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here's a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead.\"",

    "Tom...",

    "Tom!",
    "It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible!",
    "I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... \"galoogoo.\" Yeah I made it up, so what?!",
    "It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit.",
    "There's no fucking way!",

    "No.",

    "What? This is funny?",
    "What are you laughing at?",
    "You're a crazy person!",
    "Tom! You're the crazy person!",
    "What are you talking about?!",
    "One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband!",
    "This is funny to you?",
    "What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself \"Holy shit. Tom was right.\" You were right about all of it. It just wasn't me you were right about.",
    "Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well.",

    "Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9. The popular TEC-9 is advertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest customer.",
    "That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass spray gun outta South Miami.",
    "Cost three-eighty retail. I get them for two hundred and sell 'em for eight.",
    "This TEC-9? They advertise it as being the most popular gun in American crime. Can you believe that shit? It actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it. \"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,\" like they're proud of that shit.",
    "Check out this body-builder chick... Now see what she got. That's a Styer aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker. Listen.",
    "Shit's expensive, man. Comes from Austria. My customers don't know shit about it, so there ain't no demand. Baby, I could use some more ice.",
    "But put that bad boy in a flick, every motherfucker out there want one. I'm serious as a heart attack. Them Hong Kong movies came out, every nigga gotta have a forty-five. And they don't want one, they want two, cause nigga want to be \"The Killer.\" What they don't know, and that movie don't tell you is a .45 has a serious fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try and steer a customer towards a 9- millimeter. Damn near the same weapon, don't have half the jammin' problems. But some niggas out there, you can't tell them anything. They want a .45. The killer had a .45, they want a .45.",
    "Thanks, Baby.",
    "Who's your partner?",
    "Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to him, gets it to my customers. On all my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now, motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He got himself a yacht, with all kinds of high tech navigational shit on it. AK-47, the very best there is.",
    "When you absolutely, positively, gotta kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitute. That there is the Chinese one. I pay eight- fifty and double my money.",
    "You know it's for you.",
    "Girl, you better not make me go over there and put my feet to ya.",
    "Hello.",
    "It's for you.",
    "Yeah. Hey, Junebug, what's up",
    "It's boring, isn't it?",
    "I can sit through it once.",
    "He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.",
    "I'm impressed. He knows a lot.",
    "He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.",
    "Want a hit?",
    "Sure.",
    "When did you get out of jail?",
    "Four days ago.",
    "Where at?",
    "Susanville.",
    "How long?",
    "Two months shy of four years.",
    "Four years?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "What for?",
    "Bank robbery.",
    "Really, I'm impressed.",
    "Four years that's a long fuckin time.",
    "See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on \"New York Undercover\" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.",
    "What's your cost?",
    "As low as two.",
    "Are you serious?",
    "That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.",
    "I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.",
    "That's good money.",
    "Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.",
    "Then what?",
    "I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.",
    "Who is it?",
    "It's Beaumont.",
    "Beaumont\u00a2Ordell. What's the problem? What the fuck you doin' in jail? What the fuck you doin' that for? Ain't you got better sense than to be drivin' drunk carrying a goddam pistol?",
    "- Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me. Number one, you need to chill out, nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit ain't as bad as you think it is. Course you're scared. That's what these motherfuckers get paid for scarin' the shit outta ya. That's their job. And my job is to get you the fuck home so let me tell you what is gonna happen... May I speak?... Thank you... You gonna spend the night in jail; it's too late to get you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna take you into court. I'm gonna be there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll be back home, I promise. So just calm your ass down, and I'll see you tomorrow. You owe me a helluva lot more than one, nigga. See you.",
    "... the judge doesn't give a fuck about that. He's ready to habitualize you. Is that what you want - you wanna look at ten years?",
    "Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll get you out, I promise. But it means I gotta pick you up tonight.",
    "Reggie, there ain't no two ways about it. You're spending the night in jail, but I already told you I'll get you out tomorrow. Now where are you? You're at your mother's house, aren't you?",
    "Okay. Just stay put till I come for you. Reggie, do yourself a really big favor and be there when I get there.",
    "How can I help you?",
    "Where would you like me to put my ash?",
    "Use that coffee cup on the desk.",
    "And I need me a bond for ten thousand.",
    "Oh, that's just my white friend, Louis. He's got nothing to do with my business. We just hangin together. We're on our way to a cocktail lounge.",
    "Who's that big Mandingo nigga you gotcha arm around?",
    "That's Winston. He works here.",
    "He's a big one. You two tight?",
    "Yeah.",
    "It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?",
    "So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?",
    "Gonna have to put up cash.",
    "You have it with you?",
    "It's in my bag.",
    "You have cash. What do you need me for?",
    "C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it - start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.",
    "Cost you a thousand for the bond.",
    "I know that.",
    "Who's it for? A relative?",
    "Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up \"possession of a concealed weapon.\" Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.",
    "Ten thousand sounds high.",
    "They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before. Besides, Beaumont's from Kentucky, and I think they're prejudiced against black men from the South out here.",
    "He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.",
    "You think you could do that?",
    "I've done it.",
    "What's his full name?",
    "Beaumont. That's the only name I know.",
    "Records office.",
    "Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this? Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to look up the booking card and rough arrest on a defendant named Beaumont. That's all I have. I believe it's a surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.",
    "I'm going to wait in the car.",
    "Sure. We almost done, ain't we?",
    "Getting there.",
    "You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.",
    "Take the keys, man. Listen to music.",
    "Which one is for the car?",
    "This one's for the ignition... ... but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.",
    "What do I do?",
    "You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go \"bleep.\" That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.",
    "Beaumont Livingston.",
    "Livingston, huh?",
    "On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.",
    "You don't say.",
    "Do you know what he's on probation for?",
    "Haven't a clue.",
    "Possession of unregistered machine guns.",
    "Will they consider this a violation of his probation?",
    "They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.",
    "Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.",
    "I need your name and address.",
    "Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-I- E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.",
    "House or apartment?",
    "House.",
    "Now I need you to count your money.",
    "Hope you don't mind me askin' where you keepin' my money till I get it back. In your drawer?",
    "Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.",
    "Beaumont ain't going nowhere. Where do I sign?",
    "Hey, Max.",
    "Yes.",
    "I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies. I get my money back, don't I?",
    "Who is it?",
    "It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me up.",
    "Look at you and your free ass. Come over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.",
    "What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.",
    "Who was there for your ass?",
    "You were there for me.",
    "Who?",
    "You.",
    "You goddam right!",
    "You see,\u00efit works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.",
    "I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.",
    "Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.",
    "If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.",
    "How old is that machine gun shit?",
    "Three years.",
    "Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?",
    "That's not what they're tellin' me.",
    "That's why they call it \"fuckin' with ya.\" Now you wanna hear how we retaliate?",
    "Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let me tell you a little bit about my lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my own private Johnie Cochran. In fact, he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And like Johnie Cochran, dude hates fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man lives to fuck with the police. So as a favor, I had him look at your case. Stacin told me you aint got shit to worry about. They just fuckin' wit ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on their ass, make 'em - ... Stop fuckin' wit ya!",
    "Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.",
    "Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.",
    "What'd ya mean?",
    "Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor - then BAM - hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.",
    "What?",
    "I need a favor.",
    "That requires me goin out tonight?",
    "A bit.",
    "Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high -",
    "Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.",
    "What's the problem?",
    "Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I aint never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I aint worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you aint gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.",
    "Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere -",
    "- Let me finish. Can I finish?",
    "Go ahead.",
    "Now you're gonn be in the trunk holding onto the shotgun. And I'm going to tell them I'm opening up my trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad boy.",
    "Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.",
    "What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.",
    "I ain't gittin' in that trunk.",
    "We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there - ten minutes.",
    "Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?",
    "You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.",
    "Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.",
    "I can't believe you do me this way.",
    "I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.",
    "Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I do it -",
    "Look, man, I know I owe you -",
    "- Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.",
    "- I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.",
    "You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?",
    "Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?",
    "Course you didn't.",
    "But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.",
    "Just think, man. That Scoe's special, smothered in gravy and onions. Get a side of red beans and rice. Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.",
    "Now exactly how long I gotta be in this motherfucker.",
    "Don't worry. It's just me.",
    "I was wondering. Did any federal people come visit you in jail and I should be watching my ass?",
    "You wouldn't tell me if they did and I wouldn't blame you.",
    "Hello.",
    "Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?",
    "Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.",
    "Whatcha watchin'?",
    "Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.",
    "Guess where I am?",
    "I dunno.",
    "I know you don't know. I said guess.",
    "The moon - I dunno",
    "I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.",
    "You're outside?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "C'mon in.",
    "Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.",
    "I'm in my underwear.",
    "Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.",
    "You know what your problem is, Louis?",
    "You think you're a good guy. When you go into a deal you don't go in prepared to take that motherfucker all the way. You go in looking for a way out. And it ain't cause you're scared neither. It's cause you think you're a good guy, and you think there's certain things a good guy won't do. That's where we're different, me and you. Cause me, once I decide I want something, aint a goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun. Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get removed. Understand what I'm saying?",
    "Who was that?",
    "That was Beaumont.",
    "Who was Beaumont?",
    "An employee I had to let go.",
    "What did he do?",
    "He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did. And if you know Beaumont, you know there aint no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it aint gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em. Understand what I'm sayin'?",
    "Yeah.",
    "So we on the same page then?",
    "I follow.",
    "Miss Brown.",
    "Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?",
    "The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.",
    "Can I be of some assistance?",
    "I doubt it. Who's your friend?",
    "This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?",
    "Would I mind? Do I have a choice?",
    "You have the right to say \"no.\" And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.",
    "Suspicion of what?",
    "All he wants to do is peek in your bag. I'll watch he doesn't take anything.",
    "Go ahead.",
    "I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?",
    "That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.",
    "This is your money?",
    "If I were to tell you \"no it isn't...\"",
    "You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?",
    "I'm not saying another word.",
    "Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch of fuckin' pricks in Customs. Something about that job makes them kinda hard to get along with. Now, do you want to talk with a bunch of suspicious, disagreeable people like them, or a couple good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.",
    "Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.",
    "Arrest me.",
    "We could, smart ass... or we could work out what's known as a Substantial Assistance Agreement. That is if you're willing to cooperate. Tell us who gave you the money and who you're giving it to.",
    "You got a good lawyer?",
    "Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.",
    "Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?",
    "Don't know Beaumont? That's funny 'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he did know you, Beaumont was found in the trunk of a car - dead. Shot twice. Once in the head and once in the chest.",
    "I had the chance to talk to Beaumont yesterday. You see, like you, Beaumont found himself in some hot water. He was looking at ten years he was pretty sure he didn't want to do and was understandably concerned. Now maybe you don't know Beaumont, but Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.",
    "If you don't want to talk to us, I guess we'll just have to hand you over to Customs.",
    "Okay, let's go.",
    "You know, Miss Brown, there's basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE. Victims, witnesses, innocent bystanders... You ain't any of these. Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law. That ain't you either. Where you belong is the third category. The category we refer to as LOSERS.",
    "I'm not a loser.",
    "Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away. Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?",
    "You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here, he wouldn't say. Could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to?",
    "I'd like your permission to open this again. So we'll know exactly how much money we're talkin' about here.",
    "Help yourself.",
    "While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?",
    "My pocketbook.",
    "What's in it?",
    "Beauty products.",
    "I'll count the money.",
    "What's this?",
    "That's my diet shit.",
    "Let's see what else is in there.",
    "Oh, Miss Brown?",
    "Yeah?",
    "And what would this be, Sweet and Low?",
    "What the fuck is that shit?",
    "I know what it looks like.",
    "You planted that shit on me.",
    "Look, that shit ain't mine.",
    "It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?",
    "Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.",
    "I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.",
    "Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you have a seat and tell us who might know something about this fuckin' shit.",
    "If she'll cooperate with us, we'll turn possession with intent into plain ol' Possession, and she can bond outta here for one thousand bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll go for the Intent and request a twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.",
    "You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.",
    "Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty- five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.",
    "Who's side are you on?",
    "I beg your pardon?",
    "What if I plead guilty?",
    "And cooperate? You might get probation.",
    "If I don't cooperate?",
    "With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.",
    "Brown. Case number 700324.",
    "The charge is possession of Narcotics with the Intent to Distribute. How does your client plead?",
    "She wishes to stand mute, your honor.",
    "Very well... ... Detective Dargus - You're the arresting officer in his case, correct?",
    "That's correct, your honor.",
    "You have a recommendation for bail?",
    "Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the defendant's prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation, the State requests a bond of no less than twenty-five thousand.",
    "I'll set bond at ten thousand and set the date of August 14th for the arraignment.",
    "When is that, your honor?",
    "That's six weeks from now, Miss Brown. We'll continue this matter then. Owens, case 72242.",
    "Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you wash your hands.",
    "Comfortable?",
    "The door was opened, so I just came right in.",
    "I can see that. Why?",
    "I got some more business for ya.",
    "Oh, yeah? What did he do?",
    "She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.",
    "The bond for possession is only a thousand.",
    "They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.",
    "It still sounds high.",
    "She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty-five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.",
    "Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.",
    "Somebody already did.",
    "What?",
    "You didn't hear?",
    "Hear what?",
    "Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out - hey, that rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.",
    "Did the police contact you?",
    "Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.",
    "The stewardess. Do you know her last name?",
    "Brown, Jackie Brown.",
    "What does she do for you?",
    "Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.",
    "Beaumont worked for you.",
    "That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!",
    "Was she?",
    "Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?",
    "You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.",
    "If there's no - what do you call it - confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?",
    "Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.",
    "Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?",
    "You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement -",
    "- Jackie aint got time for all that shit -",
    "- I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.",
    "I got it. I just don't got it on me.",
    "Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.",
    "Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.",
    "If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.",
    "Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck - but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.",
    "Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.",
    "Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused -",
    "Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?",
    "Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit - and mind you, I said \"if\" - it was just her shit to get high with.",
    "Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?",
    "Okay, man. I got your money. But don't you ever ask me for no fuckin' favor.",
    "Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral",
    "I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.",
    "But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.",
    "I know. That's why I went.",
    "But then you told her you were home.",
    "Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.",
    "I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?",
    "I understand.",
    "I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.",
    "I understand.",
    "Then say \"Yes, Max. I understand.\"",
    "Yes, Max, I understand.",
    "Dropping off and picking up. Dropping of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown, Jackie.",
    "So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?",
    "I'll call her.",
    "Won't forget?",
    "I won't forget.",
    "Thanks, Max. See you later.",
    "FADE UP:",
    "Max! Here she comes.",
    "Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm your bail bondsman.",
    "I can give you a lift home if you'd like?",
    "Okay.",
    "Are you really a bail bondsman?",
    "Who do you think I am?",
    "I gave you my card there.",
    "Can I see your I.D.?",
    "You're serious?",
    "Who put up my bond? Ordell?",
    "In cash.",
    "Can we stop for cigarettes?",
    "Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?",
    "I don't think so.",
    "It's okay. It's a cop hangout.",
    "Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?",
    "I thought you might want a drink?",
    "I'd love one, but not there.",
    "We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.",
    "Is it dark?",
    "It's kind of a sports bar",
    "That doesn't sound dark.",
    "Why does it need to be dark?",
    "'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.",
    "Great.",
    "No thanks, I quit three years ago.",
    "You gain weight?",
    "Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.",
    "That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.",
    "What's your brand?",
    "Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.",
    "Was she helpful?",
    "She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know - I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.",
    "You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like' fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.",
    "You're not tired of it?",
    "I am, as a matter of fact.",
    "What have they told you?",
    "So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?",
    "I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.",
    "Shit.",
    "But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?",
    "Sure.",
    "You know who put the dope in your bag?",
    "Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. \"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?\" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.",
    "They wanted you to tell them what you know.",
    "I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.",
    "What did they want to know?",
    "Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.",
    "Can I get you two some popcorn?",
    "No, thanks.",
    "That would be Beaumont Livingston.",
    "That's him. How do you know 'em?",
    "I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.",
    "Ordell pick up his bond?",
    "Same as you. Ten thousand.",
    "The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.",
    "You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.",
    "I didn't?",
    "No, you didn't. What branch?",
    "Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.",
    "He's the one who wants you.",
    "It was the other guy who busted me.",
    "'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?",
    "I have a pretty good idea. Ordell aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.",
    "I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.",
    "How many trips did you make?",
    "With ten thousand? Nine.",
    "He's got that kinda money?",
    "It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's - what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?",
    "Cash poor?",
    "That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.",
    "If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?",
    "Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.",
    "Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.",
    "Yeah, if I cooperate.",
    "Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.",
    "But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name - I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it - That don't give me much to bargain with.",
    "Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?",
    "What'dya think?",
    "I think maybe I have more options than I thought.",
    "How you doing, Ms. Jackie?",
    "I was expecting you. Come in.",
    "You got some booze?",
    "I got some vodka in the freezer.",
    "Got some o.j.?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?",
    "Sure.",
    "You gonna thank me?",
    "For what?",
    "Who you think got your ass outta jail?",
    "The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.",
    "Hey, you get caught with blow, that's our business.",
    "It wasn't mine.",
    "Oh, shit. I bet it was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie. Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in there if you didn't. Oh, man, that shit's uncalled for, baby, and I apologize. I 'magine they asked you a shitload of questions about it, huh? All that money, want to know where you got it?",
    "I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.",
    "They asked.",
    "And what was your answer?",
    "I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.",
    "You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.",
    "You're not asking the right questions.",
    "Beaumont Livingston.",
    "I knew it.",
    "And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.",
    "Yeah?",
    "I didn't tell 'em anything.",
    "My name come up?",
    "You say anything about me?",
    "Well, that's mighty honorable of you.",
    "This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?",
    "They told me.",
    "Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin some time. I'magine from time-to-time they asked you a whole shitload of questions. And you didn't give 'em no answer?",
    "You scared of me?",
    "You got a reason to be nervous with me?",
    "Where is it?",
    "Is that what I think it is?",
    "What do you think it is?",
    "I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.",
    "You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.",
    "What the hell you doin'?",
    "Shut your ass up and grab the wall!",
    "Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.",
    "The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.",
    "Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.",
    "Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?",
    "Baby, I ain't come here -",
    "I said, you understand what I'm saying",
    "I understand woman, damn!",
    "Go sit over in that chair.",
    "I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.",
    "Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.",
    "Put both hands behind our head.",
    "This shits gettin silly now...",
    "I gotta tell you to shut up one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.",
    "I just came here to talk.",
    "Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?",
    "Well, I can get you a good lawyer -",
    "Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.",
    "- Baby, I didn't -",
    "- It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.",
    "Yeah?",
    "One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.",
    "I got a problem...",
    "All your money's in Mexico.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.",
    "I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.",
    "Talk to you tomorrow.",
    "You want your gun, don't you? Come in. I'll go get it.",
    "Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I asked to borrow it you'd say no. You'd have to. Would you like some coffee?",
    "If you're having some.",
    "I am. Have a seat.",
    "You get a chance to use it?",
    "I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.",
    "Black's fine.",
    "You want to hang on to it awhile? It wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -",
    "Thanks, but I have my own now.",
    "You went out this morning and bought a gun?",
    "What, I couldn't hear you?",
    "You went out this morning and bought a gun.",
    "Let's just say I got one, okay?",
    "Somebody loan it to you?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Want to hear some music?",
    "Sure.",
    "I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.",
    "It looks nice.",
    "You never got into the whole CD revolution?",
    "I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.",
    "Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on records.",
    "I don't buy new stuff that often.",
    "This is pretty.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Who is this?",
    "The Delfonics.",
    "'76?",
    "'74, I think.",
    "It's nice.",
    "I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.",
    "Are you?",
    "I don't know yet. 'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.",
    "What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.",
    "I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.",
    "Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.",
    "It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in.",
    "How'd you find that out?",
    "He told me last night.",
    "He called you?",
    "He came by.",
    "What?... What'd you do?",
    "We talked.",
    "He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.",
    "Why?",
    "He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?",
    "No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.",
    "Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever used. He can't trust his other people. They're crooks. He can try bringing I in himself, but Ordell sure don't want to go through no Customs line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess, or he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can.",
    "How do you get it out?",
    "Same way I been don', but first they got to let me go back to work.",
    "You're gonna offer to set him up?",
    "If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.",
    "It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.",
    "I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.",
    "How do you feel about getting old?",
    "You're not old. You look great.",
    "I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?",
    "It's not really something I think about.",
    "Really?",
    "Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.",
    "How'd you feel about it?",
    "I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.",
    "It's different with men.",
    "You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.",
    "In fact, I'd make a bet that except possibly for an Afro - you look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine.",
    "My ass ain't the same.",
    "Bigger?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Nothin wrong with that.",
    "Does something else worry you?",
    "I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?",
    "Fifteen thousand.",
    "Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits , ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.",
    "Come in.",
    "Great, you're here.",
    "Hey, Jackie.",
    "Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?",
    "Take your time.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Well just be a minute.",
    "Can I smoke?",
    "Go ahead.",
    "What's going on?",
    "She wants to make a deal.",
    "She sound scared?",
    "She almost sounds scared.",
    "What's she want?",
    "She wants to go back to work.",
    "What's she willing to give us?",
    "She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.",
    "She knows it's my case?",
    "She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.",
    "Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?",
    "I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.",
    "We can look into that.",
    "I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.",
    "You know what we want.",
    "If I'm working, I can help you.",
    "Help us do what?",
    "Help you get Ordell Robbie.",
    "Oh, so now you know him?",
    "You never asked me if I did or not.",
    "But now you're telling us now you do.",
    "'Course I do - I deliver money for him.",
    "No shit. You know how he makes hi money?",
    "He sells guns.",
    "You ever see him sell guns?",
    "No.",
    "Then how do you know he sells guns?",
    "He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?",
    "How can you help us?",
    "Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.",
    "You don't want much, do you?",
    "Can you do it or not?",
    "It's your call.",
    "It's possible.",
    "We're back.",
    "'Ola!",
    "Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.",
    "We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.",
    "I didn't look like a bum.",
    "But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.",
    "Goddam, girl. You gettin' high already. It's only two o'clock.",
    "It's that late?",
    "Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.",
    "Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.",
    "You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs, ain't ya. Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.",
    "Hello. Hey, Jackie...",
    "I was gonna tell you...",
    "No, not on the phone, let's meet somewhere. But you gotta make sure they ain't followin' you...",
    "Is it ready to go?",
    "Yeah, there's another hit left.",
    "The Cockatoo Inn.",
    "The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?",
    "It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...",
    "Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?",
    "It's a cockatoo.",
    "You okay?",
    "Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.",
    "Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air - in this case smoke - to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.",
    "Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile. So since you like gettin' high so much, why don't you stay here with Melanie, get high, and watch cartoons?",
    "Way ahead of you.",
    "So you just watch this for the next three hours, and I'll be back. Then, when I'm through with all my business, I'll get high. I get high at night. Walk me to the door, space girl.",
    "Hope you don't mind keeping him company.",
    "No problem.",
    "Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.",
    "I'll be back in an hour, man. Just hang with Mel.",
    "Want a Metrix?",
    "What's a Metrix?",
    "It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.",
    "It's a diet thing?",
    "No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.",
    "No thanks.",
    "How old were you here?",
    "Which one?",
    "The roller disco one.",
    "Fourteen.",
    "You're fourteen years old here?",
    "Yeah.",
    "I thought you were sixteen.",
    "I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.",
    "Were you a disco girl?",
    "Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.",
    "So where did you go?",
    "The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.",
    "That was taken at a place called \"Flippers.\" It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?",
    "No.",
    "Where were you?",
    "Detroit.",
    "With Ordell?",
    "We had done time together already.",
    "Were you a disco guy?",
    "No.",
    "C'mon, don't lie.",
    "I don't like dancing.",
    "Did you ever go I one?",
    "I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars. Who didn't make the cut?",
    "That's a picture of me in Japan.",
    "You been to Japan?",
    "I lived there for about nine months.",
    "You lived in Japan, when?",
    "About five years ago.",
    "Who's arm is that?",
    "That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hir.Hirosh.",
    "Must of made quite an impression.",
    "I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.",
    "That sounds like a problem.",
    "Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.",
    "Wanna fuck?",
    "Sure.",
    "That was fun.",
    "Yeah, that really hit the spot.",
    "Now that's over, let's get to know each other.",
    "I gotta remember this place. This is all right. Two minutes from your crib, ten minutes from your work. Not bad...",
    "What's your drink, brother?",
    "Screwdriver.",
    "How you doin'?",
    "I'm fine.",
    "Yes, you are.",
    "I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.",
    "I do okay.",
    "You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?",
    "I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.",
    "How the fuck they know that?",
    "I told them.",
    "Three twenty-five.",
    "Keep it.",
    "Thank you, sir.",
    "You told em? You told em it's me?",
    "They already know it's you.",
    "Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!",
    "Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.",
    "Didja tell 'em anything else?",
    "I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.",
    "You told them that?",
    "It's true, isn't it?",
    "What the fuck's that got to do with it?",
    "They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million - they don't give a fuck about that - They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.",
    "What did they say?",
    "Yes.",
    "... so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit's too competitive. Piss the wrong person off, you get shot. So he says, fuck that - moves over to guns. You can sell guns wherever there's a demand. No one gives a shit. He acts like he's this big international arms dealer, when, come on, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.",
    "He seems to be making out.",
    "Is it dead?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.",
    "I wouldn't go so far as to say that.",
    "He moves his lips when he reads, what does that tell ya. Let's say he's streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's still a fuck-up.",
    "He killed a man worked for him the other night.",
    "So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?",
    "That's not what I'm saying at all.",
    "No.",
    "He went to meet that stewardess.",
    "Does that bother you?",
    "Please.",
    "You live with him.",
    "I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?",
    "Uh-huh?",
    "Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.",
    "And your point is?",
    "Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...",
    "Uh-huh?",
    "... and just take it from him.",
    "... I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.",
    "Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.",
    "You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.",
    "That's a good idea.",
    "If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.",
    "Who?",
    "I don't know. One of your friends.",
    "A woman.",
    "If you want.",
    "Yeah, I think a woman.",
    "The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...",
    "But you don't?",
    "No, I give it to someone else first.",
    "And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.",
    "That's the idea.",
    "So we need two people, two women.",
    "Can you cover that?",
    "I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?",
    "I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.",
    "I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?",
    "Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.",
    "Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.",
    "I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.",
    "Managers get ten percent.",
    "That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.",
    "I'll give ya ten.",
    "Plus the same deal as before.",
    "I can do that.",
    "You have on message. Sent at 8:06 P.M.",
    "Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just calling to find out how everything went today with A.T.F. If you want to call me, my home number is 555-6788, or you can reach me at my office, which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on the card I gave you when we first met - I don't know if you still have that - but it's on it - Oh, let me give you my beeper number. It's 555-7839. Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope everything's well. Bye-bye.",
    "End of message.",
    "FADE UP ON:",
    "The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes - you got somebody yet?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Who?",
    "What'd you care?",
    "Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.",
    "I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.",
    "Don't forget your bag.",
    "walks into the food court. He stands looking a all the international fast food choices in front of him. As he tries to decide, he hears from behind him;",
    "Max.",
    "Well, hello.",
    "Surprise.",
    "I walked right past you.",
    "I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?",
    "Catching a movie.",
    "What'd ya see?",
    "\"American Prseident\"",
    "How was it?",
    "Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.",
    "Oh, are you? Does she know that?",
    "No... ... I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.",
    "What's up with this shit.",
    "I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.",
    "Does it happen to all men?",
    "Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.",
    "And Annette's it for you?",
    "For now. These relationships never last too long.",
    "That's a goddam man for ya. Can't even be faithful to a fuckin' movie star.",
    "Who was your girl before Annette?",
    "Sandra Bullock. You know her?",
    "Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in \"Speed.\" She's cute.",
    "She's adorable. But I had to end it.",
    "Why?",
    "I'm old enough to be her father.",
    "How old's Annette?",
    "I don't care.",
    "What're you, a bag lady?",
    "I go back to work tomorrow.",
    "You talk them into it?",
    "They seem to like the idea.",
    "Bring the money in and they follow it?",
    "Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.",
    "You don't actually do it that way?",
    "He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to follow the shopping bag.",
    "Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.",
    "Right around here, in the food court.",
    "Sit down, leave the bag under the table?",
    "Will Ordell go for that?",
    "I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.",
    "He was here?",
    "Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.",
    "I called you last night.",
    "I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.",
    "You think he's got a thing for you?",
    "Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.",
    "I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?",
    "He's setting me up to make a proposition.",
    "I see.",
    "You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.",
    "Has he hinted around?",
    "Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.",
    "You know some interesting people.",
    "We weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.",
    "Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?",
    "He tries to act cool.",
    "No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.",
    "What about you Max?",
    "What? If I was in Nicolet's place?",
    "No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.",
    "If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?",
    "You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.",
    "A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.",
    "You're avoiding the question.",
    "Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.",
    "I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.",
    "Why?",
    "A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.",
    "When did you decide?",
    "It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind - I guess it was Thursday.",
    "Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.",
    "The day you got me out of jail?",
    "Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.",
    "Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "I dropped you off...",
    "Went to my office, found out you took my gun...",
    "Got another gun and a stun gun...",
    "And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.",
    "What do you do when he comes home?",
    "Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.",
    "You do that?",
    "That's my job.",
    "Did you do it that night?",
    "He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew - So after a couple hours I think, \"What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.",
    "And is that it?",
    "More or less.",
    "I'm not sure you answered my question.",
    "Which one?",
    "If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?",
    "I believe I said I'd be tempted.",
    "Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...",
    "What if I've figured a way?",
    "Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye bye... Bye bye... Goodbye",
    "We gotta stop meeting this way.",
    "How was your flight?",
    "Fine.",
    "Bet you're happy to be working again.",
    "This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.",
    "What are you doing?",
    "I'm recording this.",
    "I thought you were going to let this one through.",
    "We are. Don't worry about it.",
    "Every step of this goes in my report. I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.",
    "The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.",
    "What time do you have to be there?",
    "Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.",
    "What's her name?",
    "He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?",
    "She leaves, somebody'll be on her.",
    "But you're not going to stop her?",
    "The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...",
    "A Broadway shopping bag.",
    "A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag with handles and brown lettering.",
    "Caf\u008a mocha.",
    "You want whipped cream on that?",
    "No, thanks.",
    "Think of it as money that shouldn't even be here. I mean does anybody have a right to it?",
    "The feds. It's evidence.",
    "It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.",
    "Is this seat taken?",
    "Have a seat.",
    "You're hungry?",
    "Yes'm.",
    "Put your bag on the floor, okay? Under the table, right next to mine.",
    "Then when I leave, well, you know. What's your name?",
    "Sherona?",
    "Go ahead, start eating.",
    "Would it bother you if I smoked?",
    "Sheronda, can I ask you a question? Are you and Ordell married?",
    "He say we like the same thing as married.",
    "Do you live together?",
    "Most of the times.",
    "Not every day?",
    "Sometimes every day, for a while.",
    "Then you don't see him for a few days?",
    "Yes'm.",
    "You know what's in the bag you're taking?",
    "He say is a surprise.",
    "Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.",
    "You said it yourself. Ray wants Ordell, he don't give a shit about the money. Money won't convict him, guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in their lap, they take it. If they know they got it, they'll look for it... but if they don't...",
    "You're rationalizing.",
    "That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.",
    "It could work... If she handles the cops right, I could work...",
    "Check this out.",
    "How much is there?",
    "Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.",
    "Can I ask you about Melanie?",
    "Sure.",
    "What's your relationship?",
    "She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.",
    "She believed you?",
    "Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.",
    "Do you trust Melanie?",
    "If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say \"thank you\" and I'll tell you, \"you're welcome.\"",
    "That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.",
    "She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?",
    "Yep.",
    "You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.",
    "Well, why the fuck keep her around?",
    "'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.",
    "Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?",
    "I don't hafta trust her, I know her.",
    "What does that mean?",
    "You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.",
    "I still don't understand why you keep her around.",
    "I told you, man. She my fine little surfer gal.",
    "What?",
    "It's Jackie.",
    "... Now she's gonna pout...",
    "Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.",
    "She gonna hafta find her sandals... find her bag... find her sunglasses... take twenty damn minutes get her ass out the door. Jackie - his is Louis, Louis - Jackie. And the chick stompin' around in the other room is Melanie.",
    "You have a nice time, hear?",
    "Drink?",
    "I need to talk to you alone.",
    "I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.",
    "What the hell you talkin' bout?",
    "Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.",
    "How do you know she did that?",
    "I was there, I saw her do it.",
    "Well, you weren't supposed to be there.",
    "I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.",
    "Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.",
    "Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.",
    "Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It ain't no big thing. The woman you saw was my friend, Simone. She's the one gonna be receiving the money, so I just wanted her to see how it works. She'll be here any minute. Nice woman, you'll like her.",
    "Louis, call Simone and tell her to get her tail over here. We're waitin' on her ass.",
    "I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I can't tempt you?",
    "Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.",
    "Man, I don't like that part.",
    "It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.",
    "She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.",
    "Are you sure she don' know about the money?",
    "She don't know shit about the money.",
    "What does she think she's gettin?",
    "I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither. No answer?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.",
    "No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?",
    "Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?",
    "She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.",
    "Designer clothes.",
    "She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.",
    "The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.",
    "Why we doin' I there?",
    "I have a hunch they'll be watchin' me. We can't risk switching bags out in the open or even in the dining area. That's why it has to be a woman, 'cause we do the switch in the fitting room.",
    "So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car - mission accomplished.",
    "Where you gonna be during all this?",
    "I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.",
    "I gotta go.",
    "Who's paging you?",
    "Ray, the A.T.F. guy.",
    "That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.",
    "If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.",
    "Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.",
    "And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.",
    "We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.",
    "Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.",
    "Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?",
    "He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.",
    "Don't you know all them bail bondsmen are crooks...",
    "Do you have a phone?",
    "Yeah, it's in the back.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Hey!",
    "Oh, hi.",
    "Buy ya a beer?",
    "I'm waiting for the phone.",
    "Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.",
    "Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.",
    "I know what you and Ordell got goin'. You sit down and have a beer with me. I'll tell you a secret.",
    "Sure.",
    "Great... ... Wanda!",
    "What?",
    "This lady is thirsty.",
    "What do you want?",
    "What's on tap?",
    "Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and Killian's Red.",
    "Killian's.",
    "Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?",
    "Uh-uh.",
    "Gimme one anyway.",
    "You got it.",
    "How long you been with Ordell?",
    "This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.",
    "What were you two fighting about?",
    "He told me to go outside. \"You may leave us now.\" It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be \"the man.\" You know Mr. Walker don't you?",
    "Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.",
    "That coke was yours, wasn't it?",
    "Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about that. I hope they don't come down on you on my account. Ordell shoulda told you it was in your bag.",
    "Seven dollars.",
    "He said he didn't know about it.",
    "You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.",
    "He killed a guy who works for him the other day.",
    "Beaumont Livingston?",
    "You already knew that?",
    "Kinda.",
    "So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag - Is it tempting?",
    "I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to carry in ten thousand dollars, that would be the last motherfuckin' time he saw me. The next trip you're gonna have over half-a-million. If you thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure as hell wouldn't blame you.",
    "You think I'm kidding?",
    "Dreaming.",
    "You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. half-a-million dollars. Need help?",
    "Keep it between us girls?",
    "What's that fucker ever done for us?",
    "I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.",
    "Chicken shit.",
    "Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.",
    "You two meet?",
    "This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.",
    "You talk to him?",
    "Not really.",
    "His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.",
    "What for?",
    "Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?",
    "I imagine shit needs to be done.",
    "We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.",
    "They served two years together almost twenty years ago in Soledad. But he doesn't live in Hermosa Beach. Ordell's got him staying at a house in.",
    "... Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief - woman named Simone Hawkins.",
    "Ever meet her, or they talk about her?",
    "Not yet.",
    "Who's the other one?",
    "White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.",
    "What's her story?",
    "It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.",
    "And splittin' with her?",
    "I'm sure that was the idea.",
    "What did you say?",
    "I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.",
    "She told you that?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Was she there?",
    "She didn't say.",
    "But she mentioned Beaumont by name?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?",
    "Right. Everything's the same, except one change...",
    "I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.",
    "Do you think they bought it?",
    "Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.",
    "You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.",
    "All he needed was a reasonable explanation.",
    "Right. Everything's the same except one change. Ordell thinks it's just too hot right now to bring in all his money. He knows you're watching him, and he's paranoid. He's keeping his stash where it is, but he wants to bring in fifty thousand for bail in case he needs it.",
    "It'll be more than that.",
    "Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.",
    "But you still have to show him the money at the airport.",
    "Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.",
    "Where's the rest of it?",
    "In the bag underneath.",
    "What if he checks it?",
    "He won't - I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is - on top.",
    "You're takin' a helluva chance kid.",
    "Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.",
    "Then you're out and you get nothing.",
    "Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.",
    "You're gonna have surveillance all over you.",
    "That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.",
    "In a dress.",
    "Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.",
    "Excuse me.",
    "It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout - everything's the same - except for one change. That bitch you saw in the mall, Simone. She wasn't here today, cause she split on me. Me an Louis went over to her place ,she's gone. She's gone and all her shit's gone and so's my ten thousand dollars. It ain't nothin' to worry about, girl. Everything's just like we discussed. Except when you do the switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna be Melanie.",
    "Chicken shit.",
    "Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink and you spend half the fuckin' flight in the can. Soon as we land I'm making a formal complaint.",
    "Why, because I called you an asshole.",
    "You didn't call me that.",
    "I didn't? Oh, well, you're an asshole.",
    "We have to stop meeting like this.",
    "You said that the last time.",
    "Well, it's true, isn't it? After his is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?",
    "We could, if I'm not in jail.",
    "Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.",
    "Are you saying I'm off the hook?",
    "Free as a bird. I still expect you to finish the job, though. How much do you have this time?",
    "Fifty thousand, like I said. He's pretty sure he's gonna need it for bail.",
    "That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.",
    "I was told ten thousand in each pack.",
    "You didn't count it?",
    "I never have. It's not my money.",
    "He might have slipped some coke in here. Did you check?",
    "Mr. Walker promised he'd never do that again.",
    "Ever been tempted?",
    "What? To put one of these in my pocket?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?",
    "Yes. All those things are true.",
    "After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?",
    "That would be one point of view.",
    "Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.",
    "How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?",
    "I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you. Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?",
    "Si.",
    "I'm going out for a few hours.",
    "Hold on a minute. Where you going?",
    "I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.",
    "Watcha gonna see?",
    "Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.",
    "Have fun.",
    "What the fuck are you two still doing there?!",
    "I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.",
    "Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.",
    "Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'",
    "Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.",
    "We're leaving now!",
    "All right already.",
    "Can I help you?",
    "Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.",
    "Oh, my God. You look so cool.",
    "This looks pretty good on me.",
    "Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.",
    "I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?",
    "Not a problem.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Jackie?",
    "Hi, Melanie.",
    "Are you getting that black suit?",
    "Yeah, do you like it?",
    "It looks good on you.",
    "Do you got something for me?",
    "You betcha.",
    "We coulda worked this. You know that, dontcha? You would've made out a lot better than you're going to, believe me.",
    "I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?",
    "Thanks.",
    "Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.",
    "I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit - get out of that damn uniform.",
    "Oh, that's not a problem.",
    "Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels.",
    "Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She took the money.",
    "Melanie burst in the dressing room and took the money!",
    "Come on, goddammit, we're late!",
    "Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.",
    "We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!",
    "... You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room...",
    "That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.",
    "Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?",
    "Are you sweating?",
    "Job a little too much for you?",
    "I'll be over here. You're too conspicuous.",
    "Goddammit, not till I tell ya.",
    "What are you doin'?",
    "I'm getting out of here. What do you think?",
    "Lemme have the bag.",
    "Fuck you. I can carry it.",
    "Goddam you. Gimme that bag,",
    "Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?",
    "Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.",
    "Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's wrong with you?",
    "I'm carrying it.",
    "Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.",
    "Fuck you with your chill pill.",
    "Remember where we came in?",
    "Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came in through Bullocks. I know where it is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?",
    "You have no idea where you parked, do you?",
    "Jesus, but if you two aren't the biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my life... How did you ever rob a bank? When you robbed banks, did you have to look for your car then too? No wonder you went to jail.",
    "Is it this aisle, Lou-is?",
    "Yeah, down the end.",
    "You sure?",
    "Is it this aisle or the next one over?",
    "This one.",
    "You sure?",
    "Don't say anything else, okay? I'm telling you, keep your mouth shut.",
    "I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.",
    "Okay, Lou-is.",
    "See, just where I fuckin' said it was!",
    "Hey, look. I found it!",
    "Can I show you something?",
    "Not right now. I'm just killing time waiting for my wife. But thanks, anyway.",
    "Sure thing. If anything grabs you, don't be shy.",
    "Thanks, I won't.",
    "Oh, my God. You look so cool.",
    "And away we go.",
    "Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in there. Looks like beach towels.",
    "Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks. You walk over to that counter, you're gonna find out what it's like.",
    "Excuse me, but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room?",
    "Yeah, I think they're back there. Go get 'em. There's nobody in there. I think they're in the last stall.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Got 'em, thanks.",
    "Sure thing.",
    "There a Ordell here?",
    "That's me.",
    "Don't talks all day.",
    "It's Louis.",
    "Did you get it?",
    "I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.",
    "When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?",
    "I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.",
    "Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.",
    "That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time -",
    "- Not now, pick me up.",
    "You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about. Hey, where's Melanie?",
    "That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. \"Is it this aisle Lou-is, is it that one?\" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.",
    "So what, you left her there.",
    "I shot her.",
    "I expect she's dead.",
    "You shot Melanie?",
    "Twice. In the parking lot.",
    "Couldn't talk to her?",
    "You know how she is.",
    "You couldn't just hit her?",
    "Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...",
    "You shot her twice?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "So you're sure she's dead.",
    "Pretty sure.",
    "Where did you shoot her?",
    "In the chest and stomach.",
    "Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.",
    "Louis?",
    "What?",
    "Where's the rest of it?",
    "How much it there?",
    "Maybe forty, maybe not that much.",
    "You said five hundred and fifty!",
    "So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.",
    "Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.",
    "Came outta where?",
    "The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.",
    "How long was she in there?",
    "Maybe a minute. She came right out.",
    "Louis, You tellin' me the truth?",
    "Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.",
    "Then what?",
    "We went to the parking lot.",
    "Where you shot her.",
    "That's right.",
    "You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?",
    "Fuck you for asking me that.",
    "Pull the car over.",
    "What'd you shoot her with?",
    "It's in there.",
    "What's that gonna tell you\" If I was really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken two out, wouldn't I? I thought you trusted me.",
    "Gotcha, nigga.",
    "TO:",
    "Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.",
    "If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?",
    "'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.",
    "Maybe the Feds got it.",
    "If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.",
    "That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.",
    "Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.",
    "I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.",
    "Or... ... she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.",
    "Jesus Christ.",
    "What?",
    "You know who I saw in the dress department?",
    "Tell me.",
    "I didn't really think anything of it. No - I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.",
    "You gonna tell me who it was?",
    "Max Cherry.",
    "You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars - Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!",
    "Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?",
    "Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.",
    "How am I supposed to know that?",
    "You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?",
    "Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?",
    "Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!",
    "I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.",
    "Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!",
    "You best back off.",
    "What the fuck happened to you, man? Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.",
    "You didn't tell me you were gonna do some shopping.",
    "I thought I did.",
    "You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.",
    "I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit - Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.",
    "But you didn't do that.",
    "Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it.",
    "Where's the bag she gave you?",
    "She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.",
    "You took the time to pay the saleswoman.",
    "I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.",
    "What did you do after that?",
    "I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.",
    "There was a guy with Melanie?",
    "Not in the fitting room.",
    "We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.",
    "This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?",
    "I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?",
    "It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?",
    "I have no idea.",
    "You'd take a polygraph on it?",
    "If it'll make you happy.",
    "I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.",
    "Can I have a word with you?",
    "Sure.",
    "Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.",
    "I thought you were watching him.",
    "We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.",
    "So what happens now?",
    "We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.",
    "What about me?",
    "What about you?",
    "Do you think I took some of that money?",
    "I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.",
    "I'll settle for Ordell with the marked bills.",
    "If you have something else going on you haven't told me about, it's between you and Ordell. All I gotta say is, you better hope we find him before he finds you.",
    "... I can't leave here today... Mr. Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I get my money... You wouldn't have that fuckin' boat weren't for me. Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my friends are... Mr. Walker?",
    "Can you believe that shit? Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate nigger. Do things for people and that's how they treat you. Goddamn girl, how can you live like this?",
    "Like what?",
    "Girl, this shit is repugnant.",
    "Cherry Bail Bonds.",
    "Let me speak to Max Cherry.",
    "He ain't here right now.",
    "He leave town?",
    "He's around.",
    "Give me his home number.",
    "I'll give you his beeper.",
    "Hello.",
    "I've been looking for you.",
    "You know who this is?",
    "Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.",
    "The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?",
    "She got off, huh?",
    "They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.",
    "You still there?",
    "Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.",
    "You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?",
    "Cops can't locate him, huh?",
    "They don't have your winning personality.",
    "Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.",
    "I think I do. Is that good enough?",
    "Hello.",
    "I know where he is.",
    "How'd you find out?",
    "All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.",
    "How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?",
    "People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.",
    "He's liable to shoot you.",
    "On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.",
    "Ray wants him.",
    "Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.",
    "That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?",
    "It's not that simple.",
    "It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.",
    "So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?",
    "Get Ordell to come to your office.",
    "Set him up.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Tell him you want to see him?",
    "Tell him I want to give him his money.",
    "Why?",
    "I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.",
    "What do you tell Nicolet?",
    "Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.",
    "We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet - is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?",
    "He's already there.",
    "What if he hears something he's not supposed to?",
    "Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?",
    "What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?",
    "I thought you might be asleep.",
    "You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.",
    "I'm alone.",
    "Git your ass in here.",
    "You better freeze, motherfucker!",
    "You want your money? Your bond refund?",
    "That's all?",
    "I have a bond receipt for you to sign.",
    "You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?",
    "She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.",
    "How'd you find me?",
    "Winston found you.",
    "How the fuck did he find me?",
    "That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.",
    "Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Well, give it to me then.",
    "She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.",
    "I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.",
    "Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.",
    "Lift up your pant leg. You help her?",
    "All I did was walk out with it.",
    "And you did that to protect my interest?",
    "In a way, yes.",
    "My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.",
    "This place stinks.",
    "You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.",
    "My office.",
    "And where's Jackie?",
    "She's been there since Thursday night.",
    "She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?",
    "She was afraid.",
    "That I gotta see.",
    "She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.",
    "Have her bring the money here.",
    "It's in the safe. She can't get at it.",
    "Call her, tell her the combination.",
    "I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.",
    "You expect me to just walk in there?",
    "If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.",
    "That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?",
    "She's all alone.",
    "I call your office, she better answer the phone.",
    "She will.",
    "I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.",
    "All the time I've known her, I never heard her sound scared like that. Ordinarily she's too cool for school. I'm driving, gimme the keys.",
    "It's the next street.",
    "I know where it is.",
    "Turn left.",
    "I know where to turn.",
    "My money's in that office, right?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it. I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?",
    "No.",
    "You sure?",
    "Yes.",
    "You better be, motherfucker.",
    "Get ahead of me and open the door.",
    "Step inside easy.",
    "Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting in the goddamn dark for?",
    "Mark... ... he's got a gun!",
    "He's dead.",
    "Does he have the marked bills on him?",
    "In his inside coat pocket.",
    "Why were you with him?",
    "I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.",
    "How'd you know where he was?",
    "I found out.",
    "And you didn't tell the Police?",
    "I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.",
    "Remember when Ray said you hoped you'd get him before he got me?",
    "Well, you did. Thank you.",
    "",
    "Knock knock.",
    "Hey.",
    "Mark... he's got a gun!",
    "Hey, you.",
    "I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.",
    "Less ten percent.",
    "Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.",
    "Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.",

    "You sound like Anheuser.",
    "Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady?",
    "A little.",
    "You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital? `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done.",
    "There would have been chaos, sir.",
    "You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself.",
    "Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser.",
    "But sir?",
    "Go. That's an order Helmsley.",
    "Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her.",
    "I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies.",
    "Gordon's right. Look at this mess.",
    "You don't understand, it's our only chance.",
    "This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China?",
    "Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California.",
    "Careful with the landing gear! Tamara, get the boys out of the way!",
    "Attention! The US National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas.",
    "We strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately...",
    "Let's move people! Inside the terminal!",
    "Where's Anheuser?",
    "In the command center, sir.",
    "The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to.",
    "So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship? Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.",
    "What about the Speaker of the House?",
    "In this chaos... I have no idea!",
    "But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think -",
    "I don't care what you think, Helmsley.",
    "Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady... and because of all that affirmative action bullshit.",
    "There was a white kid, much more qualified than you. Just so you know.",
    "Where is my father?",
    "He wanted to stay with his people.",
    "We have to go back!",
    "Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the Captain.",
    "There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter.",
    "Tell the Captain, to take off immediately.",
    "People, stay away from the windows!",
    "We can't get stuck here.",
    "Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here?",
    "She's a patient, honey.",
    "Nice work.",
    "You bastard. You knew it all along! You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours...",
    "I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them.",
    "Can you still fly that thing?",
    "Sure... But I need a copilot.",
    "Gordon is a pilot.",
    "Let's go!",
    "Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back!",
    "Wow, that is a big plane.",
    "It's Russian.",
    "Guys, follow me!",
    "You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold...",
    "... Sit down and buckle up!",
    "Wow! Look at those!",
    "We had VIP tickets for that.",
    "You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.",
    "Uh... What?",
    "Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay?",
    "Move back, people... down on the floor!",
    "We have to get going!",
    "We're going, we're going.",
    "We're not gonna make it!",
    "Shut up! We will!",
    "GOVNO! (shit). Help me pull!",
    "Was that the Eiffel Tower?",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China.",
    "Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it, Neng.",
    "But Lin is my brother. He is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made.",
    "What is in your wisdom for us to do, great Lama... if Lin is right, if our world is indeed coming to an end?",
    "It's full, great Lama. It can hold no more!",
    "Like this cup, Neng, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you wisdom unless you first empty your cup?",
    "Be careful with the clutch. It tends to slide.",
    "Bata! Neng is coming!",
    "Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on.",
    "I thought Lin is working on the dam?",
    "The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood.",
    "Not here in the mountains... Let's eat first.",
    "No mother! We must pack up right away.",
    "We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way.",
    "Neng, I did not know you were coming for dinner.",
    "Look, the new Bentley.",
    "Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year.",
    "But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships.",
    "If I was rich, I'd get one of those.",
    "We have one. How many cars does your family have?",
    "My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4.",
    "Our parents are divorced too.",
    "Nothing we can do about that.",
    "Wow... look at this.",
    "Be careful, Noh'!",
    "How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he?",
    "I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids...",
    "Did your husband ask you to get your's done?",
    "We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them.",
    "I bet he did.",
    "What did the man pay for mommy?",
    "Nothing, Lil'bee.",
    "What's your situation?",
    "Way too complicated...",
    "They seem to like each other.",
    "I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay?",
    "One billion euro, per seat.",
    "That's disgusting.",
    "You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach... ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'.",
    "What would you have done, if you rich like me? Just look at your gorgeous kids. And call me Yuri...",
    "Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I will do the rest.",
    "Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying.",
    "Why did you give up?",
    "It didn't work.",
    "What about the wheels we lost at take- off?",
    "There's 14 on each side. Some of them must still be there.",
    "Still nothing from the tower?",
    "Guys, you really oughta take a look at this.",
    "What is that?",
    "The State of Hawaii!",
    "Not good. That is not good.",
    "How much fuel do we have?",
    "Not enough. We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea.",
    "At least we won't need our landing gear.",
    "What about it?",
    "We lost it all... in Vegas.",
    "Can I come in?",
    "I've got nothing to say to you.",
    "But I do...",
    "Your Dad and I... we were trying to protect you.",
    "I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need protection. You used me. You guys had me gallivanting around the world, as part of your little cover-up.",
    "But you were doing a good job.",
    "Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso. But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough. People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God.",
    "You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself.",
    "That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive.",
    "That's not true.",
    "What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane?",
    "Zero. What's your point?",
    "It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.",
    "Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your presence immediately.",
    "What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me...",
    "I need to know that too, Adrian.",
    "One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too.",
    "She can't find her mother.",
    "Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do.",
    "Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross...",
    "No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley.",
    "I know, she was amazing.",
    "Who can help me with missing persons?",
    "Sorry man, I'm busy right now.",
    "I mean, of course sir. I didn't realize... What can I do for you, Mr. President?",
    "Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son...",
    "The capitol was hit by a 9.4.",
    "We lost communication with the White House, sir.",
    "President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space.",
    "That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command.",
    "... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action...",
    "Hold on back there!",
    "Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither.",
    "Anything?",
    "Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal.",
    "I can't think about what's going on down there.",
    "I wanted to thank you. For coming back for us.",
    "I couldn't have left you...",
    "Do you think people change?",
    "By `people' are we talking about me?",
    "Do you think you've changed since we separated?",
    "Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now...",
    "You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson.",
    "Do you love him? Gordon...",
    "I love him enough.",
    "... Cho Ming reports the first tremors, however none higher than 5.0.",
    "The crust has begun to shift, Prof. West.",
    "By what degree?",
    "1.2 percent, but still moving.",
    "Any clue what to expect next, Professor?",
    "Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir... proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes.",
    "Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard?",
    "We've recorded two quakes averaging 8.3.",
    "... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water...",
    "I called... But I never got through.",
    "I'm so sorry.",
    "Tony!!",
    "I'm coming home Dorothy...",
    "All global ground communication has ceased sir.",
    "The only signal our satellites are picking up are coming from the vessels in Cho Ming.",
    "At least some good news.",
    "Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment?",
    "We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours.",
    "... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation.",
    "Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... ... These are their new positions.",
    "So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?",
    "It's the south pole, sir.",
    "What's that?",
    "Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready.",
    "Let's go wake up the kids.",
    "Why do you hate Gordon?",
    "What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon.",
    "But you don't like him either.",
    "I don't know him that well.",
    "But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well.",
    "I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise.",
    "Is it time?",
    "Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to land.",
    "What's wrong?",
    "Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet.",
    "Your daddy has to tell you something.",
    "I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both...",
    "I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been.",
    "... And I am so very sorry for that.",
    "Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys should come back up here.",
    "Don't ask me how that happened.",
    "There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go.",
    "It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles...",
    "No shit. It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958.",
    "Way to go Charlie!",
    "We lost our last two engines.",
    "I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the brake fluids. It's going to get rocky... There, the blue levers!",
    "Listen up guys! This may sound a little crazy, but here's what you got to do...",
    "Get up! Follow me!",
    "Yuri bear, what are we doing?",
    "We're taking the Bentley!",
    "CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast!",
    "Now! Open it!",
    "SHUT UP EVERY ONE!",
    "Engine... start...",
    "Voice control... Sold me on it.",
    "Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down!",
    "What about you?!",
    "I'll be fine! I have to land this thing!",
    "What are you waiting for!",
    "Push it Curtis!",
    "We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.",
    "Tamara! Open the door!",
    "Where's Sasha?",
    "He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down.",
    "Daaadddy!",
    "Everybody okay back there?",
    "We're all fine.",
    "Welcome to the People's Republic of China.",
    "Thank you... Say thank you, kids.",
    "What color are your passes?",
    "What color are your boarding passes?",
    "I have green card.",
    "For my boys and me.",
    "It's a joke... a mistake... Right Yuri?",
    "You disgust me. You pig.",
    "You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul.",
    "I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys!",
    "What!... Did that just happen!?",
    "Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same.",
    "I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you!",
    "My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father...",
    "Your party is the last to arrive.",
    "I've been told of damages?",
    "We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted.",
    "There it is!",
    "What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor.",
    "I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements.",
    "I want your name!",
    "Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained.",
    "Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great.",
    "I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it.",
    "Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments?",
    "Cheap bastard.",
    "You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?",
    "Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri.",
    "You guys hear that?",
    "Hey! Help! Wait for us!",
    "Shit! Shit!",
    "Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people?",
    "Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest.",
    "Captain? Where is the Bridge?",
    "Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.",
    "Satnam? Where are you?",
    "On the Nampan Plateau...",
    "What?!",
    "There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge!",
    "Satnam, what happened?",
    "We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came!",
    "I have to go!",
    "Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India?",
    "One moment, sir.",
    "Helmsley, what's going on here?",
    "Looks like our model was wrong.",
    "Satnam was talking about a wave from the East.",
    "Jesus!",
    "What does this mean?",
    "The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please?",
    "Satnam didn't get picked up.",
    "Ready sir.",
    "This one is at least 1500    meters high!",
    "Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us?",
    "Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down?",
    "Get me the other Heads of State.",
    "Who are they?",
    "We found them by the side of the road, my brother.",
    "You must send them back.",
    "I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that.",
    "Come with daddy.",
    "At least take our children with you. Please.",
    "Why should I do that?",
    "For the same reason you sent for your parents.",
    "I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you!",
    "We are all children of this earth.",
    "My plan will not work for so many, mother.",
    "We will take them all. Bata?",
    "Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.",
    "They're leaving without us!",
    "What did I tell you!",
    "Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too!",
    "We have to hurry! They launch! We run out of time!",
    "Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds.",
    "Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?",
    "He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me.",
    "Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand.",
    "Move Lil'bee!",
    "Oh my god, that's Yuri!",
    "Caesar!",
    "Let that stupid dog go!",
    "Okay. Now!",
    "Tamara! Come on! Get in!",
    "Down there! Oleg, you go first!",
    "Daddy look, Tamara!",
    "Caesar darling!",
    "Tamara! Get in!",
    "Come to mommy!",
    "I need your help.",
    "What in god's name is happening Adrian?",
    "Anheuser convinced them all to launch.",
    "Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.",
    "Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this.",
    "What do you think you're doing?",
    "I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on!",
    "This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson...",
    "Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann?",
    "I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization...",
    "... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die?",
    "A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. Or at least I don't want to be part of it.",
    "We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off.",
    "That's an order soldier.",
    "Don't do it!",
    "We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them.",
    "Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow.",
    "Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?!",
    "There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives.",
    "I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why?",
    "He died because we forgot to pick him up. I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children?",
    "If my father were here, he would open the gates.",
    "The people of Russia along with...",
    "... China and Japan agree to open the gates.",
    "The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister...",
    "... We vote to open the gates.",
    "Captain Michaels, you heard them.",
    "Phew... It stinks in here.",
    "Sssh...Caesar.",
    "They're opening the gate! It will crush us!",
    "Noah! Watch out!",
    "No!",
    "Something happened, mom.",
    "We have to stop it!",
    "You did it, man. You did it.",
    "What's wrong with the gate?",
    "I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir.",
    "Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay.",
    "Can you zoom in?",
    "I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it.",
    "We're loaded. We can close the gates sir.",
    "Do it!",
    "Pull yourself up!",
    "To the lower decks people!",
    "Oleg! Catch your brother!",
    "Boys, you gotta move.",
    "We wait for our father! He's still down there!",
    "There's no one down there. Come on boys, come...",
    "Why is the stern gate not closing?",
    "Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir.",
    "Captain, over here.",
    "I think we found the problem.",
    "How did they get in there?",
    "They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There...",
    "That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong.",
    "You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean...",
    "Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber.",
    "You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter?",
    "What are you all waiting for?",
    "If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start.",
    "There's no way to override it?",
    "No sir, it has to be done manually.",
    "Almost there, Lin...",
    "Water has penetrated the stern!",
    "What now?",
    "The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time.",
    "Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber?",
    "If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.",
    "Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.",
    "I was so worried about you.",
    "Mummy!",
    "Lilly run!",
    "Lilly! Take him.",
    "Is there any way to talk to them?",
    "We have to move him higher. Over there!",
    "Moving at 34 knots, sir.",
    "What is our position?",
    "Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir.",
    "You must be kidding!",
    "We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die.",
    "Mum, will this do?",
    "Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me.",
    "Lilly!",
    "I'm alright Mom!",
    "We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it.",
    "You're our only hope.",
    "I'll go back. I'll try my best.",
    "I'll go with you.",
    "You stay with Mommy.",
    "I'll be right back...",
    "Captain, what's happening?",
    "What's happening?... We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.",
    "Noah!",
    "Mom, we did it!",
    "We got it free. Can you hear me? We did it!",
    "Captain Michaels - close the gate!",
    "That's affirmative. Close the gate!",
    "Ay, ay, Sir.",
    "Engage starboard stabilizers!",
    "One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir!",
    "Noah! Where is he?",
    "He was just behind me...",
    "If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me.",
    "Whatever you do... I will never let you go again.",
    "2013",
    "... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen...",
    "...   and all we can hear is the sound of our   own breathing that reminds us we are   still sharing our memories, hopes and   ideas.",
    "... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. The end.",
    "How many copies did you say that sold?",
    "Less than 500. It's what you might call a cult classic.",
    "It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley?",
    "Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements.",
    "Actually my diary's pretty open.",
    "Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please.",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I will be giving the orders to unseal the decks.",
    "Please be careful when you step out and of course... enjoy the fresh air.",

    "There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared.",

    "That's my big girl.",

    "Of course you can. He's your doggie.",
    "You called for me, sir?",
    "Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley.",
    "Looks like your scientific projections are way off again.",
    "The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian...",
    "What's that?",
    "It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded.",
    "Our European colleagues have already set course for it.",
    "Here, somebody wants to talk to you.",
    "This is Helmsley.",
    "No, this is Helmsley.",
    "Dad!... Is that you?",
    "We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly.",
    "Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony?",
    "He's fine, son. We're all fine.",
    "See you guys soon. Bye dad.",
    "Put that woman down Helmsley.",
    "Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world...",
    "I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours.",
    "Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.",
    "There was no one.",
    "Pardon me?",
    "There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that.",
    "This is your Captain speaking. Standby to open Deck 1.",
    "Standing by Sir.",
    "I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars?",
    "Do not fear. Some things will never change.",
    "I thought you might want this.",
    "Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad?",
    "I finally finished your book Jackson.",
    "Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end.",
    "Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think?",

    "None too discreet, is he?",
    "No, sir, he is not.",
    "He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?",
    "The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...",
    "Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.",
    "Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.",
    "You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?",
    "Sure.  I'll call the guy.",
    "You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?",
    "I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?",
    "Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.",
    "Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a minute...?",
    "Okay, I've got it. Hello... sorry, I was switching phones.  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian. Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow evening should be fine...",
    "Mister Welles. You're very prompt.",
    "I try to be.",
    "I appreciate your coming on such short notice.",
    "This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney.",
    "Uh huh, pleasure.",
    "Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.",
    "Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.",
    "I'm listening.",
    "As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.",
    "Of what sort?",
    "You are a private investigator?",
    "That's right.",
    "Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.",
    "Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.",
    "Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?",
    "Thank you.",
    "He's odd.",
    "He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...",
    "I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.",
    "I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.",
    "You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.",
    "As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.",
    "My condolences.",
    "His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.",
    "I'll do whatever I can to help.",
    "His inner sanctum.",
    "Not many people have been inside this room.",
    "Pittsburgh?",
    "Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.",
    "He succeeded.",
    "We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.",
    "Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?",
    "I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.",
    "Just curious.",
    "My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.",
    "You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.",
    "There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...",
    "Do you want to tell me what you found?",
    "Cash, stock certificates, and this...",
    "It's a film... of a girl being murdered.",
    "I'm afraid I don't...",
    "This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could.",
    "I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...",
    "Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a \"snuff film.\"  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.",
    "Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...",
    "No.",
    "If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...",
    "I'm telling you it's not that.",
    "I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.",
    "Will you watch it and see for yourself?",
    "Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.",
    "You... you need to go to the police.",
    "I told you I can't, not yet.",
    "You don't have any other choice.",
    "No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...",
    "It won't work like that.",
    "Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.",
    "I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...",
    "You've found missing persons before.",
    "Nothing remotely like this.",
    "I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.",
    "This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.",
    "I understand.",
    "Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.",
    "I know.",
    "It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.",
    "Why the gun?",
    "I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution. Don't worry about me.",
    "Hello, honey, it's me. I'm fine, how are you?",
    "What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?",
    "Call me Tom.",
    "Alright, Tom.",
    "What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...",
    "There are reasons for the way we do things here.",
    "Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...",
    "Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.",
    "Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?",
    "I figured you share information.",
    "We do.",
    "For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.",
    "Why don't they come to me?",
    "This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.",
    "I'm not so sure about this.",
    "They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.",
    "I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...",
    "They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.",
    "Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.",
    "Who knows... maybe she's already given her parents a call, right?",
    "Fuck.",
    "Excuse me... Tom, hold on...",
    "Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why don't you come on back in... we'll see what we can do.",
    "This is it.  It's not much. We've got less than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in December.  I'll have someone show it to you anyway.  Other than that, I'm afraid it's the wet thumb method.",
    "Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.",
    "Any good?",
    "It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.",
    "You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?",
    "It's good what you're doing.",
    "Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles. Here's where we stand.  I checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544.  The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92... Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary...",
    "Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did.  First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo...",
    "Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.  Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around...",
    "There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact...",
    "It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it...",
    "There were three men.  Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror.  It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching...",
    "So, there were three.  They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to.  That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago...",
    "Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye.",
    "Yes... ?",
    "Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...",
    "I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.",
    "I don't understand, who are... ?",
    "I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?",
    "Yes, but...",
    "These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...",
    "What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...",
    "Neil... Neil Cole.",
    "Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?",
    "No.",
    "Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?",
    "I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ? Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright?",
    "It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.",
    "They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?",
    "That's exactly what I am.",
    "I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.",
    "You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.",
    "It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.",
    "So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?",
    "No.",
    "She just seemed... depressed... ?",
    "She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.",
    "What was she running from?",
    "I don't know.",
    "If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?",
    "Yes.",
    "September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.",
    "We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...",
    "Why do you think he did it?",
    "It got to be too much for him.",
    "You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?",
    "There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...",
    "I didn't mean to...",
    "You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.",
    "I had to ask.  I apologize.",
    "No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.",
    "People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?",
    "Of course.",
    "This is her room.",
    "The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it.",
    "Those are for her birthday.  One for every year she's missed.  They'll be waiting for her when she comes back.",
    "I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...",
    "Okay.",
    "You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey. Call him back and tell him I said so.  The goddamn thing's still under warranty. I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's hard. I've got a lead I have to follow through.  To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you.  I love you.",
    "We weren't religious.  We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids.  We never made her go to church.  But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious.",
    "Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.",
    "We're all like that.",
    "Are you religious?",
    "No.",
    "You should be.",
    "I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.",
    "What?",
    "It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.",
    "There wasn't one.  The police looked.",
    "Do you think the police did a good job?",
    "I don't know.  I think so.",
    "It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...",
    "No.  You don't have any reason to think that...",
    "If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.",
    "How... how can you say that to me...?",
    "Will you let me look?",
    "My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...",
    "You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?",
    "Go ahead and look if you want.  I don't care what you do.",

    "There's not much illegal.",
    "Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.",

    "You have to pay to come in here.",
    "You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.",
    "Interesting theory.",

    "Child pornography.",
    "There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.",
    "Snuff films.",
    "I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.",
    "What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?",
    "First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.",

    "You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.",
    "Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.",

    "Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.",
    "I was well compensated.",

    "They're no friends of mine.",

    "Shut your mouth and drive!",

    "Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?",
    "Isn't it incredibly obvious?",
    "Enlighten me.",
    "Because he could.  He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?",
    "You've got four minutes till I call Mr. Velvet and let him know there's a problem.",
    "May I show you to a booth...",
    "No, I've got it.",
    "You almost went over your limit.",
    "Fuck you.",
    "Give me the film.",
    "You'll get it when we get there.",
    "Give me the film.",
    "Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.",
    "No!!",
    "You fuckers!",
    "You're a dead man.",
    "Leave him alone.",
    "Fuck off.",
    "What the fuck... !",
    "I promised him to Machine.",
    "... sorry...",
    "First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...",
    "Don't... please...",
    "And so it ends.  It's as if she never existed.",
    "Don't blame yourself.  You were in way over your head.",
    "Motherfuckers.  Small time, motherfuckers... !  Tell me something...",
    "I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do it?  Must have been a helluva lot of money, right?  One fuckload of money...",
    "So, what are you all still doing small time, huh?  What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you ever see... ?",
    "What's he talking about?",
    "One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...",
    "He's lying.",
    "Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?",
    "What the fuck's he talking about?",
    "Stay away from me.",
    "What's going on, Longdale?  Did this happen?",
    "You sell us short, you fuck?",
    "Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me.  Now!",
    "Put it on the ground, kick it here...",
    "You fucking lawyer...",
    "Move back!  All of you... move!",
    "What were you thinking?",
    "Back off!  Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now...",
    "You're not going anywhere if you fucked us, lawyer.",
    "I'm leaving.",
    "You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?",
    "You betrayed us.",
    "Stay where you are!",
    "Keep back!",
    "You're not gonna live through this.",

    "Back off, Eddie...",
    "Stop Eddie!",
    "I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in the back... !",
    "Come back, or I put a hole in him.",
    "You might make it to your gun, but not before I shoot Machine.  And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you.",
    "Take off the mask.",
    "Take it off!",
    "You got one bullet.",

    "What's wrong?  Are you alright?",
    "I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there",
    "... What's going on?",
    "Just do it, Amy, please, go.",
    "Honey... ?",
    "Not quite.",
    "Nothing like getting home after a rough day.  Home sweet home.",
    "Walk away.  Pack your bags, put the wife and kid in the car and find a place to hide.  If you're lucky, you'll never see me again.",
    "I don't know if I can do that.",
    "I know who you are.  I know where you live.  I know everything I need to know to find you. Who am I?",
    "What happened to you?",
    "I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?",
    "What's going on, Tom?  What happened?",
    "I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...",
    "Tom...",
    "It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.",
    "Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?",
    "I don't know.  I'm sorry...",
    "You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?",
    "You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.",
    "I wanted to call.  I couldn't.",
    "You couldn't?",
    "You don't understand...",
    "No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!",
    "I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.",
    "You should have.",
    "Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.",
    "Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...",

    "Don't...",

    "Forgive me.",
    "We have to stay here a few days. I'll get more clothing from the house if I can.  I'm sorry. We're going to be okay.",

    "Mrs. Christian.",
    "What?",
    "She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.",
    "Tom... she's dead.",
    "She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...",
    "I just talked to her.",

    "Promise you'll stay.",
    "Promise you won't go back there, wherever you were.  Whatever it was, forget it.",
    "Promise me.",

    "Hello, Eddie.",

    "Don't ask questions.",

    "Starting to recognize a pattern?",
    "What do you want?",
    "Who is Machine?",
    "I don't know...",
    "I want his name.",
    "I told you, I don't know.",
    "I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.",
    "What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.",
    "Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.",
    "Yeah, the fucking lawyer.",
    "Told him you could get him a snuff film.",
    "Yeah.",
    "How much did he pay you?",
    "Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.",
    "That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?",
    "It was a lot of fucking money.",
    "So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.",
    "Something like that.",
    "What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?",
    "What the fuck do you want from me?",
    "I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!",
    "Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!",
    "You wanted to know, now you know.",
    "That's right, motherfucker, cut me loose.  Be a man.",
    "Show me!",
    "Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.",
    "Why?",
    "Because we're going there.",
    "What are we doing here?",
    "That night... you didn't have to be in the room, but you were. Why?  Why did you watch?",
    "I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.",
    "You enjoy it?",
    "Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.",
    "Tell me what happened.",
    "What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...",
    "Nobody saw you bring her in?",
    "There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.",
    "What did you do with her body?",
    "Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.",
    "Show me.",
    "What are you thinking you're gonna do... ?",
    "Keep moving.",
    "Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?",
    "You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...",
    "Stop talking.",
    "You got absolute zero.",
    "Show me where you buried her.",
    "I don't know... ... out there somewhere.",
    "Where?  Show me where.",
    "I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.",
    "You'll never find her.  Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all.  Without the film, it never happened.  Don't you get it?  It's over.  You can't do anything.",
    "I can kill you.  I can leave you out here, just like you left her.",
    "Do it.",
    "Don't think I won't.",
    "Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?",
    "Easy enough for you.",
    "I never killed anyone.",
    "That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you \"felt like it.\"  Almost makes you worse.",
    "What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?",
    "Where you going?  You're the one with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless enough?  Come on...",
    "Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name?  Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it.  Fucking do it!",
    "You pussy.",
    "Fucking pussy!",

    "No...",

    "No... no... no...",

    "... Getting stabbed doesn't make me a hero.",
    "So what'd they give the kid?",
    "They put 'im upstate in a facility until his twenty-first birthday.",
    "That all? They shoulda caned the bastard. Like they did that kid in Singapore. Remember? President of Singapore had a few choice words. Use to have it memorized... He said something like, 'When a state of increasing disorder and defiance cannot be checked by the rules... then new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order.' 'The alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy.'",
    "So why do you still teach?",
    "Same reason as you, Garfield -- for the paycheck.",
    "Okay, someone tell me the difference between the central nervous system and the lymphatic system?",
    "Mr. G, you gotta nice butt.",
    "You seem to be an expert on anatomy, Miss -- -- Nartinez. Central nervous system and lymphatic system. What's the difference?",
    "... Uh...",
    "It's like the central nervous system, that's your brain and spinal cord, and the lymphatic system, that's the stuff in your blood that fights diseases.",
    "Very good.",
    "Cesar.",
    "You writing on your desk?",
    "You see anything in my hands? I don't think so.",
    "K-O-S, what's that? That a tagging crew?",
    "Cartoon... Is that you, Cesar? 'K-O-S' has something to do with your friend Benny?",
    "... Dawg. You're a sucker. K-O-S stands for 'Kappin' Off Suckers.' Don't disrespect my homeboy, Benny. He don't like it. He don't like you.",
    "Do me a favor, Cesar. Go get a paper towel from the counter and wipe off your desk. And Mr. Littleton, please oblige me and turn that tagger shirt inside-out.",
    "Hyland said it was okay, Sucker.",
    "Don't pay no attention to them. They jus' tryin' tuh fuck wit' you, Mr. G. I mean play wit' you. Sorry I said you had a nice ass.",
    "... Apology accepted.",
    "I ain't no school girl.",
    "God forbid anyone should think that.",
    "May I come in?",
    "Yeah... ... Ellen.",
    "Trevor.",
    "I'm making time a reward instead of a distraction.",
    "Clever... Listen, I wanted to apologize for jumping up like I did at lunch. I was just feeling a little weird...",
    "It's alright.",
    "For what it's worth, Dave Childress thinks you walk on water.",
    "Is that a good thing?",
    "I think it takes a lot of courage to go back into a classroom after something like that.",
    "Not if the only thing you ever wanted to do was teach.",
    "Now you see, there's our predicament.",
    "I assume you've met Benny Chacon?",
    "I have.",
    "Last week Benny and his tagging crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in the corner over there. ... She's seven months pregnant and he's tormenting her with a broom handle... Can I help you with those?",
    "No thanks.",
    "So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny... and if the district construes it as assault and battery on a student, she's gone.",
    "They'd do that?",
    "In a heart beat. She's non- tenured, they don't want to get sued... Don't be surprised if she files for stress leave by the end of the week. Too bad, too. She's a good teacher.",
    "Can I ask you a personal question?",
    "Why'd that kid attack you?",
    "Because I flunked him.",
    "Is there any way you can see something like that coming?",
    "When they say they wanna kill you, you'd best take it serious. This kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity Transfer -- but nobody told me until it was too late.",
    "Did you know Benny's an O.T.?... In less than a year he's been convicted of felony assault and suspended twice. I even testified against him as a character witness. Now I get to see him every day in homeroom. I'm stuck with him. Condition of his probation is that he stay in school.",
    "You talk to the principal?",
    "Many times... Three weeks ago, Garcia calls Benny's mother in for a conference, but she refuses to show up. She's afraid they'll deport her because she's illegal. So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and some attorney tells her she doesn't have to come in. Garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing. This kid's threatening me and all he's worried about is a lawsuit.",
    "What'd Benny say to you?",
    "That he wanted to hurt me.   Real bad.",
    "Does he know where you live?",
    "I think so. Someone's been phoning me at night and hanging up... Two weeks ago, my car was broken into... And last Friday, I think he was inside my house... But I can't prove it.",
    "... I don't know what to do.",
    "You can quit.",
    "You didn't.",
    "Do I know you?",
    "You should. You're fuckin' with my piece, puto.",
    "... You from K.O.S.? No shit?",
    "Look, I didn't mean nothin'. Lemme fix it. I can fix it. Okay?",
    "Eh, shut up, mojado! Don't mess wit' me, whiteboy.    I'll cap yer ass.",
    "I said shut up! Shut the fuck up!",
    "I don't have no time to put up wit' 'dis shit!",
    "You think it's funny?!",
    "I don't call my P.O. in 15 minutes, I'm fucked.",
    "Dis is K.O.S.' neighborhood.",
    "Sergio Arrellano... Blanca Orantes... Andrew Blackwell... Benny Chacon...",
    "Benny's not here.",
    "I think he went AWOL, Mr. G.",
    "... Trevor.",
    "Eskander filed for stress leave. They want me to finish out the semester.",
    "That's great...",
    "It's only 'til the end of the year.",
    "Listen, I never thanked you for letting me cry on your shoulder.",
    "That's okay.",
    "Hey, have you seen Benny lately? Ford told me he hasn't phoned his P.O. in four days. You know what they say. Be careful what you pray for. Don't get me wrong, Benny's made my life a living hell. I even moved back in with my mother because of him. I love my mother, but if I eat one more dinner off a TV tray or watch one more rerun of 'Wheel of Fortune,' I think I'll lose my fucking mind.",
    "Time's up. Everyone stop working.",
    "... So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere?",
    "No.   No wife.",
    "Don't you ever get lonely?",
    "Sometimes. There's this passage in God's Lonely Man by Thomas Wolfe where he says, '... The whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.' I believe that.",
    "God that's depressing.",
    "... My New York mentality. It's not always easy looking on the bright side.",
    "Especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, I would guess.",
    "Actually, that wasn't the toughest part -- it's the robbery that's been hardest to recover from.",
    "What'd they steal?",
    "My passion. My old, unguarded self. I resent that. I want them back.",
    "They're still there. Everybody around me seems to have given up. They're all so beaten down. But you're different. You refuse to be beaten.",
    "So do you.",
    "Remember the last time a student surprised you?",
    "You mean where a light goes on?",
    "Yeah. Where the kid surpasses all your expectations.",
    "... Been awhile. So few you can actually get through to... You?",
    "... That would have to be Daniel Terrazas. This was last year sometime. Kid was failing miserably ... But he was the best Salsa dancer in the whole school.",
    "Uh-oh.",
    "So I made 'im a deal. Tutoring in exchange for Salsa lessons.",
    "Saw it... Jerry Springer.",
    "No, no. He was a perfect gentleman.",
    "Male teachers can't do things like that. They get arrested.",
    "Yep, double standard... By the way, did you know Cesar Sanchez was Special Ed? Yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D.",
    "Severely Emotionally Disturbed... that's great.",
    "Come on, Garfield -- on your feet. Lemme teach you how to Salsa.",
    "No, no, I'm no good at that.",
    "Let's go.   Don't play shy with me, homeboy.",
    "That's it... Okay, follow me. It starts on the one. Step forward with your left foot... One. Change weight on, two.",
    "And three, feet back together... Now do the same in reverse, starting with your right foot. One, two, three... One, two three...",
    "Oh, my God... your shirt.   Oh, no, I'm so sorry.",
    "It's alright.",
    "Can I help?",
    "Grab the baking soda outta the fridge.",
    "Don't start barking, Jack.",
    "Hey there, boy. You're a good dog. Yes, you are.",
    "Sorry for reacting the way I did back there.",
    "Don't apologize. That's how most people react.",
    "Didn't scare me. It just surprised me.",
    "... Thanks for dinner.   I had a good time.",
    "You're welcome.",
    "Here... you need a little life in that place of yours.",
    "... Good night.",
    "... Night.",
    "Since some of you seem to have an interest in anesthetics, I've prepared a little demonstration.",
    "Rita, bring your friend in the cage over here, please.",
    "His name's Snowball. Like 'dat lil' pig dude from Animal Farm.",
    "You've read Animal Farm?",
    "... schoolgirl.",
    "Shut up, Cesar.",
    "You read Animal Farm, Cesar?",
    "No, but I fucked a sheep.",
    "Cesar, come up here. I want you to have a front row seat for this.",
    "And remove the 'lokes.'",
    "Why your eyes so red?",
    "Mus' be pink-eye, sir.",
    "Nice watch, homes. Can I have it?",
    "Rita, would you bring me a sugar cube from the shelf over there?",
    "Cesar, read Young's rule for us. Page 564. At the top.",
    "I ain't gonna read 'dat shit.",
    "Rita, give Cesar your book.    Let 'im read.",
    "Forget it.",
    "'Young's rule...' Go on.",
    "",
    "Stoopit bitch.",
    "Touch her again, Cesar, and you'll answer to me personally.",
    "You like her, Mr. G?",
    "Shut up!",
    "Settle down, everyone. We all have to learn how to forgive and get along. C'mon, Cesar, read. Please.",
    "... Young's rule... ff... fo...",
    "... Formulates.",
    "... I say everyone deserves another chance. Whadda you say, Cesar?",
    "Rita, would you please read Young's rule for me?",
    "... 'Young's rule formulates proper dosage levels for children and adolescents.'",
    "Thank you.",
    "... In the brown bottle I have a prescription for liquid Demeral.",
    "Where'd that come from, sir?",
    "A doctor.",
    "Demeral is a morphine sulphate... and is soluble in water.",
    "Young's rule says, divide the age of the patient by the patient's age plus twelve, giving us the fraction of the adult dosage suitable for the patient.",
    "In Snowball's case, I've calculated the dosage necessary to tranquilize a one-year-old child... then further divided that fraction by 30, based on his weight, to arrive at .002 milligrams.",
    "... Don't worry, he'll be back to normal in exactly 10 minutes.",
    "... He shoulda woke up by now?",
    "You just caught a murder case, homes.",
    "Okay, anyone who didn't finish answering the questions on 246, finish them for homework.",
    "Hold it, Cesar.",
    "Where's my watch?",
    "Hey, I gotta go. I ain't got no watch.",
    "Empty your pockets, both of you.",
    "Want me to break it down to you? I gotta catch a bus.",
    "Sorry. I'm trying to catch Hyland before he leaves.",
    "I've been meaning to come by your room.",
    "... It's almost been a week.   My guess is you're avoiding me.",
    "You okay?",
    "Has nothing to do with you, Ellen. It's... hard for me...",
    "Pretty much been like that since... you know, my accident. Has nothing to do with you.",
    "Is it because I'm white?",
    "No.",
    "We can still be friends.   Just don't pull away.",
    "Now, can I ask you a favor? After you're done with Hyland, can you give me a ride to my car? It's at the mechanics, about five or six blocks up Lankershim. If you can't, it's okay, I can walk.",
    "... I think I can manage that.",
    "Que paso, Victor?",
    "Base three to base one. 'Found 'im.",
    "Mr. Garcia would like to speak with you in his office.",
    "You don't mind if I tape record our conversation. Matter of record. You understand. Of course, you know Mr. Hyland.",
    "Am I being questioned?",
    "Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Littleton tell me you've accused them of stealing your watch. If that's the case, I need to address the accusation.",
    "... For the record, I primarily suspect Mr. Sanchez. Although I wouldn't be surprised if Stevie was an accomplice. Beginning of sixth period, Cesar admired the watch. I believe his exact words were, 'Can I have it?' Either way, I'd like my watch back.",
    "Anything else?",
    "When I asked him to empty his pockets, Cesar refused.",
    "Is that true, Mr. Sanchez?",
    "No way. He never asked me nothin' like that! I don't go 'round taxing no teachers...",
    "Okay.   Calm down.",
    "... I ain't got no watch, man.",
    "Mr. Littleton, may we see your pockets too?",
    "I'd like a locker search, please.",
    "You're excused, gentlemen.   Take your things. Thank you.",
    "... Let me try and explain something. I try and think of our students here at John Quincy Adams like they're my clients. I can't accuse anybody just on your hunches. I need more than that. I need facts. I won't have another law suit like we did with that Blackwell case. Boy's mother spent $400 that she couldn't afford on new clothes for her son. Unfortunately we considered the clothing gang attire and sent the boy home. That cost the district a quarter of a million dollars. So I want you to be straight with me, Mr. Garfield. Did you physically see Cesar take your watch?",
    "No, I didn't...",
    "Do you have any witnesses who saw him take it?",
    "... No.",
    "Unless there's reasonable cause to show that Cesar, or Mr. Littleton took your watch then I can't authorize a locker search. I'm sorry. Any concerns regarding my decision, you can look up in the handbook. It's section 628.1 of the Education Code.",
    "That was my grandfather's watch. Can't you see what they're doing? Weren't you ever a teacher?",
    "Afraid I never had the privilege. Teaching and being a principal don't necessarily go hand in hand, Mr. Garfield.",
    "Is it me or is Garcia a real asshole?",
    "I've been thinking about videotaping my classes.",
    "... Yeah, well, here's some free advice. Cover your ass.",
    "If Garcia asks, your main purpose is to observe you, not the students. Excuse me, I mean his `clients.'",
    "Some gangbanger might think we're violating his civil rights...",
    "... Yeah?",
    "Sorry, Iris. Completely forgot.",
    "Yuh have a minute? Wanna talk to you about our discipline committee. Gotta run up to the office real quick first.",
    "Yeah, fine, go ahead.   I'll wait.",
    "... I have to fly up there for a computer conference.",
    "When's that?",
    "Day after tomorrow.",
    "Never been to San Francisco.",
    "Oh, you should go sometime, Trevor. I think you'd like it. Really. It's only an hour by air. Maybe five or six by car. Completely different attitude from L.A. Much more like a real city... like Chicago or New York...",
    "... Only problem is I hate to leave Jack with my mother for any extended period of time. I'm afraid she'll forget to feed him and he'll starve to death.",
    "If you want, I'll take care of Jack.",
    "I can't ask you to do that.",
    "Sure you can.",
    "... Aren't you supposed to be at P.E. fifth period?",
    "... Sunland Boyz gettin' crazy, ol lady's... fucked up. Fuck dis being down shit. I wanna do somethin' wit' my life.",
    "... You know this guy?",
    "'Gotta make J-C next year. 'Got to! I ain't never gonna get up outta here.",
    "Rita, slow down.",
    "'Dat bitch Quinn, I'm 'onna sue her ass. 'Swear tuh God...",
    "Okay, okay.   Calm down a second.",
    "Who's Quinn?    What's she teach?",
    "English Comp.    She's failin' me.",
    "'Bitch say I don't talk right.",
    "She hates me.    She's racist against me.",
    "Just cause you're a Latina doesn't mean everyone's racist against you.",
    "Hey, I'm a La Raza, prof-eh.",
    "Okay... just stop blaming everyone else. You're too smart for that. And every mistake in that essay is fixable, okay? So relax, it's not the end of the world.",
    "Tissues are in the first drawer.",
    "How come you always wear so much makeup?",
    "... To make me pretty.",
    "You don't need it.",
    "That your name?",
    "It's a gang thing. But I'm kickin' dat shit... Jus' cuz I look down for my neighborhood don't mean I'm stupit.",
    "I know you're not.",
    "The ideas in your essay aren't the problem, Rita. It's your punctuation and grammar. They need work. Am I lying? If you want help I'm here for you. Okay?",
    "... I dunno.",
    "Have to be in the library after school.",
    "... Somebody could see us.",
    "All right then, I'll come to your house.",
    "No... No way.",
    "Where then?   You name the place.",
    "Dog, you invadin' my privacy. Bitch.",
    "Cesar, would you come up here please?",
    "Since you were so concerned, I though you might like to know... I found my watch.",
    "... You broke into my locker. Dat's a serious felony, prof-eh. You caught a case for sure now.",
    "Whadda yuh propose to do, Cesar? Tell Garcia? Whadda yuh gonna tell 'im? That I broke into your locker to steal back the watch you denied taking? I don't think so. I'd say we're even now, wouldn't you, Cesar?",
    "No, I'd say we're just getting started, ese.",
    "Want something to drink?    We have Coke, Fanta or Sprite...",
    "... Coke's awright.",
    "'Want you to know, you're not the only one risking a reputation here. Normally I don't tutor students at my house. Rita, maybe you can clear something up. Can you explain to me what machismo is all about? Cuz this whole respect/code of honor thing baffles me.",
    "Ask yourself this question. Is pride really that important?",
    "Put your clothes on, Rita.",
    "No harm done... Don't cry now.",
    "Why don't you go ahead and copy the first rule there for the verb 'to be.' Can you do that for me?",
    "I jus' wan'ed to thank you.",
    "You don't have to thank me, I'm your teacher.",
    "... From now on I think the best thing for us to do is meet in the library.",
    "himself ... I'll try.",
    "I ain't getting it. You get it.",
    "Si, maestro.",
    "Entre, por favor.",
    "Hello, Cesar.",
    "Como paso eso? Arriba del       happen...",
    "Nada... es nada.",
    "Puto! You lied to Benny. You said you don't speak no Spanish!",
    "No I didn't.",
    "'At's bullshit!",
    "Enjoy hitting your mother, Cesar? You must be proud of yourself.",
    "... He's lyin', man. Fuckin' liar! Homeboy don't never disrespec' his mother. Never. You hear me, joto?!",
    "Whatever you say, Cesar.",
    "I'll find out where you stay. Trucha, homes!",
    "Valla ala chingada!",
    "'Scuse me. What's going on? Lakesia, who opened the door?",
    "It was like that when I got here.",
    "Whoever did this is gonna pay! Better believe it, ese(s).",
    "Get the hell outta here!",
    "Dave... Barsek, don't touch anything, okay?",
    "Get out!!",
    "Oh, damn. Lookit the rat.",
    "Think it's funny?! Huh?!       Yuh little fuck!",
    "Dave!   No!   Let go of 'im!",
    "D'you do this?!",
    "Nooo...",
    "He didn't do anything.    He's a good kid.",
    "Been smokin' the chronic, Cesar?",
    "I'm hooked on phonics... not 'hooked on chronic.'",
    "You wouldn't happen t'know who vandalized bungalow eighty-six last night?",
    "You guys know anything about that? Sorry, maestro... nada.",
    "Garcia may not think there's enough here to prove anything. But you and I both know who's responsible. Don't we?",
    "Whadda you, a narc? Seriously, I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about.",
    "The ring, Cesar... lemme have it.",
    "Watch it, eh... that's my trigger finger.",
    "It's inappropriate attire...",
    "... Bang.",
    "... Are you finished?",
    "What? Finished with what?   Don't get crazy on me, dude.",
    "... These conferences mainly focus on software now.",
    "Software sells.",
    "So, how's Jack?",
    "... Jack's good.",
    "And what about Trevor?   Was Trevor a good boy, too?",
    "What's that supposed to mean?",
    "Nothing...",
    "Is that supposed to mean something?",
    "Trevor...",
    "Can't you see I'm talking to the lady?!",
    "... I'm sorry.     Forgive me.",
    "... Come out, come out, wherever you are. Where is he?",
    "Jack?",
    "Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to Mommy, sweetheart.",
    "... Oh, my God.",
    "Jack?!",
    "Jack!",
    "... Jack.",
    "Don't beat yourself up too much. It was an accident. He was probably after a cat... or someone walked past back here in the alley. Whatever it was, he jumped over the fence. What can you do?",
    "It's aspirin...",
    "... I can't talk to you right now, Trevor. Please. I'm so upset I can't even drive. I just need some time alone.",
    "I know about what's not fair. I left part of my lung in a damn hospital because some gangbanger didn't like the grade I gave him. Sometimes you do all the right things. You work hard in school... get a good job... pay your taxes. Things still go bad. I'm so sorry, Ellen.",
    "... 'At you, Stevie?",
    "... Hells, man. Stupit dog.",
    "... Mutha fuck.",
    "Trevor?",
    "Trevor?",
    "... Where'd you put the aspirin?",
    "My finger. Please, somebody help me! Where's my finger?!",
    "... I put it on my mother, sir.",
    "... So your science teacher shot you with an arrow full of drugs then chopped off your finger. Come on, you can do better than that, Cesar.",
    "It had to be him!",
    "He smoke the `mota' for yuh, too, eh ese?",
    "Pinche madre... he hates my guts, man!",
    "You covering for somebody, homes?",
    "Cuz, this circumstantial bullshit won't hold up in court, I'll tell you that right now.",
    "Caught too many priors, Cesar. Juvenile GTA, vandalism...",
    "I know he did it! Don't you hear what I'm saying?",
    "You saw his face?",
    "Yeah, yeah. I seen him.",
    "Lemme save yuh from perjuring yourself, asshole... You're full of shit.",
    "I swear it!   For reals!",
    "C'mon, this guy's wasting our time. Come up with something better than that, or the truth, then maybe we'll talk.",
    "... Name one of four parts that make up the human hand?",
    "... Hands, please.",
    "Christian.",
    "... The metacarpals.",
    "The Metacarpals. That's one. Name some more?",
    "Rita.",
    "The wrist... and thumb.",
    "Good. ... And don't forget the phalanges.",
    "Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges...",
    "May I come in?",
    "Hi.",
    "Where'd you go the other night?",
    "I was going to ask you the same thing.",
    "... I went for a run. Wanna get some Chinese later? There's a new place in the Valley Center. 'Spose to be pretty good.",
    "... Can't tonight. Maybe another time.",
    "... I should probably correct papers anyway. Some of these bungalow kids actually care about a grade. Even Cesar's doing better. Today, for the first time since I took over for Eskander, he actually did his work. Today Cesar Sanchez was a success. Maybe for the first time in his life. You alright?",
    "... Much better, thank you.",
    "... I really am sorry about Jack.",
    "... Finished.",
    "... Let's hava look..",
    "... Good. ... I was just thinking, since your essay's about gangs and getting away from their influence, you probably could've left some of those double negatives you like so well.",
    "So now you wan' me to use bad grammar.",
    "Only if it suits your topic.",
    "I know. We're all products of our environment 'n' shit.",
    "No, I think that's just an excuse. I say if we're strong, we can rise above adversity. But it's like rap or hip-hop... Correct all the grammar and it loses its impact.",
    "So you like hip-hop, Mr. G?",
    "... I hate it.",
    "What kinda black man are you?",
    "Why you here anyways? Don't you got nothin' better t'do?",
    "... Everything I wanna do is right here. It's a good essay, Rita. You put a lot of effort into it, it shows.",
    "Comes from the heart, maestro. I'm a writer... not a fighter.",
    "... Ms. Quinn was telling me she picks two seniors each year to read their essays at graduation.",
    "She ain't gonna pick my paper. Anyway, I don't wanna get up in fronna all those people and make a fool outta myself.",
    "Why not?   It'd be a Pyrrhic victory.",
    "What's dat?",
    "... In your case, irony. Refers to King Pyrrhus. Never mind. Look it up sometime.",

    "Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the time, and you don't do shit.",
    "It's my problem.",
    "No, it's mine too. Cause we're brothers. That's what brothers do. They fight for each other, kill for each other, die for each other.",
    "I don't feel that way.",
    "Cause you're a pussy. So stay home, keep your head under the blankets. I'm gonna fight.",
    "Some provisions.",
    "We're only gonna be here a couple of hours.",
    "When two o'clock rolls around, you'll be begging for one of these.",
    "I didn't bring my glove.",
    "Moron, the bat is for Jeff and Kenny. You know, to scare them a little.",
    "Maybe it's best if we don't talk. Just listen. Listen for them, and don't fall asleep.",
    "I'm wide awake. I could stay up all night.",
    "Oh, shit.",
    "What... What is it?    They here?",
    "No.",
    "Where you going?",
    "They're not gonna show up, I'm goin' home. It's three o'clock-",
    "Now yours.     And aim for the window.",
    "Ha ha, you suck.",
    "You hear that?",
    "Put it out! Put it out!",
    "They're in there!   They're in there!",
    "Wake up!   Wake up, kid!",
    "Ashley?    What is it?",
    "I forgot to deposit your paycheck last week.",
    "But I already wrote some checks.",
    "I know. With the cookout and everything, I forgot. I'll deposit it tomorrow. The holiday should buy us an extra day.",
    "Write yourself a note so you don't forget again.",
    "I just did.",
    "Goodnite.",
    "Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene Carges. May God hold you in the palm of his hand.",
    "Friend or family?",
    "Huh?",
    "The person who died.",
    "Friend.",
    "I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung. This is only my second session, but she's good.",
    "I'm not a patient.     I'm her daughter.",
    "Oh.     I can see the resemblance.",
    "Are you trying to make me sick?",
    "Mr. Maitland?",
    "I'll be with you in a second.",
    "So, how was it?",
    "It was a funeral, Mom.     How do you think it was?",
    "I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let Rudy's parents know I'm available if they need to talk. I won't charge for the sessions.",
    "You know, it's okay to cry.",
    "I know it's okay to cry. I don't need you to tell me, it's okay to cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry.",
    "Okay.",
    "Ashley, there's more than enough food here.",
    "No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs. It's right that I make them. Where's the paprika?",
    "Jesus, you put something down, and it disappears.",
    "Maybe I threw it out.",
    "It's okay.",
    "Not my baby! Please God not my son!",
    "This hospital is a nightmare. The elevator is never there when you need it.",
    "Where are the girls?",
    "Haley took Sara up to the maternity ward.",
    "How are you feeling?",
    "My head hurts.",
    "You're lucky you didn't get killed.",
    "I told you, I'm sorry.",
    "You try being awakened at four o'clock in the morning by the police saying, they have your son, he's unconscious and on his way to the hospital. I've never been so scared in my life. And poor Rudy.",
    "What?",
    "My best friend is dead!",
    "Eat this.    It'll make you feel better.",
    "I'm not hungry. Besides, I can't taste anything anyway.",
    "Hospital food is always bland. This has flavor.",
    "No, it's because of my condition. I can't taste or smell anything anymore.",
    "What are you saying, condition? What condition?",
    "My condition.",
    "Leonard has a condition.    It's called Anosmia.",
    "Oh my God!     Is it serious?",
    "No. Anosmia is when a person looses their sense of smell. It's not uncommon in patients who suffer serious head injuries. Unfortunately, it's also affecting his ability to taste. Again, not uncommon.",
    "Is it permanent?",
    "Depends on the patient.",
    "What do we do? He can't eat.",
    "He can eat. He just can't taste what he's eating.",
    "What she means is, he won't eat.",
    "Leonard's association with food is no longer about taste. It's about texture. While we may be partial to sweet or salty foods, Leonard will become partial to crunchy or smooth ones. Once he settles on a texture he likes, his appetite will increase.",
    "I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Considering what Leonard could have suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he is severely overweight. A loss of appetite may be a benefit.",
    "How'd we do?",
    "You have to eat something. It may not be gourmet, but you don't look that finicky.",
    "This stuff feels like shit in my mouth.",
    "It's macaroni and cheese.",
    "It feels gross. Like there's a film on my tongue.",
    "I don't like apples.",
    "So, you can't taste it, right? Maybe you'll like the crunch.",
    "I'm leaving, Jim.    Again, so sorry.",
    "Gabe, are you still interested in buying the land? Because I accept your offer.",
    "This is hardly the time to talk business.",
    "Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear them down and build. Build houses, condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I just don't want to recognize it ever again.",
    "It's gone!     It's all gone!",
    "If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking out right now.",
    "You holding up alright, Jacob?",
    "I'm sorry. I wish I could have done something.",
    "Jeff and Kenny were the ones that started the fire. It was their fault. Or maybe mine. I should of been there.",
    "You wouldn't have been able to do anything. And it could have been you who died.",
    "I wish it was. You know the last thing Rudy said to me? He said, I can't be a pussy all my life. He was right, I am. And Rudy might be dead because of it.",
    "Don't say that. Why don't you talk to your parents about this?",
    "They can't help me.",
    "Give them time. It'll get better.",
    "What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't gone back to work yet. What if he loses his job. We could lose our house. I could be homeless.",
    "Then you'll stay with me.",
    "Or me.",
    "We're best friends.    We...",
    "Oh my God.",
    "What?",
    "That guy. I like know him. He's one of my mother's patients.",
    "So?",
    "I've never seen a patient of hers actually out and about. Should we go over and say \"hi\"?",
    "I just want to get out of here.",
    "You coming, Malee?",
    "Are we having company?",
    "No, this is all for you. Your favorites; fried chicken, spaghetti, pizza, french fries, and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. I made everything extra spicy, so you can taste it.",
    "Ma, it doesn't matter how spicy the food is.",
    "So you're not even gonna try it?",
    "I'm sure it's delicious.",
    "Forget it.     Don't eat.",
    "You can't just eat apples all the time.",
    "Why not?",
    "It's unhealthy.",
    "Tommy Wallace.",
    "Jacob Carges.",
    "Rudy Carges.",
    "Rudy Carges. Hello?",
    "He's not in this class anymore.",
    "How do you know?",
    "Cause he's dead.",
    "I realize being new at this school puts me at a disadvantage, but joking about a fellow classmate's death is anything but funny, Mr....",
    "...Carges.     Wait, are you...",
    "I'm his brother. Was.     And I'm not joking. He's dead.",
    "I'm so sorry. Wow, this is awkward. Would you like the seat left empty?",
    "Why?",
    "In memory.",
    "Alright, ladies, welcome to gym. We will be starting things off this year with the United States Standardized Fitness Test.",
    "I'm sure you all remember it from last year. I will be testing you in a number of physical fitness areas.",
    "The state's requirement for upper body strength is ten chin ups.",
    "Leonard, you're up.",
    "What are you doing, let's go!",
    "That was as far as I could pull myself up.",
    "Ten seconds. You need forty to pass.",
    "Time.   42.     Good job.",
    "Go!",
    "Come on, son, fight it.",
    "23 minutes.",
    "Not bad.",
    "The goal was 8.",
    "Hit the showers.",
    "Not you Leonard.",
    "Center. That's the position you'll be playing in two years.",
    "Football?",
    "You don't like football?",
    "I love it. It's just I'll never make the weight requirement. Pop Warner league wouldn't let me play for five years because of it.",
    "There's no weight requirement in high school ball, son.",
    "These are your new bibles.",
    "Books?",
    "One is on nutrition, the other exercise. You do what they say, and you can play for me once you get to high school.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Coach, why are you doing this for me?",
    "Because I've never seen a child so out of shape in my life.",
    "Did anyone practice over the summer?",
    "Great. Well, we still have a fall recital coming up. If anyone would like to perform a solo, sign up on the sheet outside my office. Class dismissed.",
    "No, they're wrong.    Call them back.",
    "Ashley, I talked to the lawyer.   He wouldn't lie.",
    "What's going on?",
    "This is all your fault.",
    "Me?",
    "If we had gone to the hearings like I said, this wouldn't be happening.",
    "We agreed it would be too painful.",
    "You agreed.",
    "Mom, what happened?",
    "Tell him.    Tell your son.",
    "The boys who killed Rudy cut a deal. They got a year in juvinile hall and five years probation.",
    "A year. That's what your brother's life is worth. A damn year!",
    "Ashley, calm down!",
    "How can you be so unaffected by this! How? Our son was murdered!",
    "It was an accident, and the boys are juveniles.",
    "So that makes it okay?",
    "Don't I know you?",
    "Dr. Chung's daughter.",
    "You remembered. We were never introduced. My name is Malee.",
    "Gus.",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "I was in the mood for a picnic. I thought this would be a nice place to have one.",
    "Asshole, move your fucking truck!",
    "Would you like to join me?   There's plenty of food.",
    "I don't go to lunch for another ten minutes.",
    "I'll wait. Meet me by the cement mixer when you're ready.",
    "The last time I saw you, you had just come from a funeral. How are you doing?",
    "Okay. Death is like so weird. I mean, it's sad, but I also feel like I've been given this sign. A sign which is telling me, life is short, so you gotta do what makes you happy. You gotta take chances. You gotta get crazy.",
    "What are you doing to \"get crazy\"?",
    "I play the flute.",
    "Yeah, that's totally nuts.",
    "No, not that. See, every year my school has this recital. I've always been too scared to play a solo in front of people, but this year I've decided to do it.",
    "Good for you. When is it?",
    "Why do you care?",
    "Cause I'm gonna go.",
    "What? You can't go!    Nobody goes to these things. I don't even think my mom is going.",
    "You gotta have somebody rooting for ya. Besides, I like music, and I owe you for bringing me lunch.",
    "Okay. Tuesday at 8:30 in the junior high school auditorium.",
    "I'll be there.",
    "Don't say it if you don't mean it.",
    "I'll be there.      Front row.",
    "I can't believe how much you suck at this game.",
    "You wanna play again?",
    "No.",
    "You wanna shoot some hoops?",
    "No. The sentencing thing totally upset my mom. She was up half the night, crying.",
    "I can't believe it either. A year ain't shit! Rudy is dead forever.",
    "I want them dead. I want to kill them. I could handle a year in Juvy hall.",
    "Whoa, what those guys did was an accident. If you were to kill them, it's premedicated. You'd get 20 years to life at least.",
    "So I'm just supposed to sit here and take it? Be like you guys.",
    "What is that supposed to mean?",
    "You seem to have gone on with life pretty easily. Don't you miss him? Don't you care?",
    "It's not that we don't care.     It's just...",
    "Life goes on.",
    "It does. You have to deal with it. If you don't, it could like eat you alive forever. 90 percent of people's problems is due to their inability to get over the past.",
    "How do you know?",
    "My mom tells that to all her patients. I've eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions.",
    "That's awesome. Can I listen in sometime?",
    "No. Anyway, she says, if a person wants closure, they gotta deal with their problems head on. Go see these guys and let them know how you feel.",
    "I don't think my parents would be up for that.",
    "Go alone. Juvy hall is only like forty minutes from here. Take the bus.",
    "Bye, Dad.",
    "Where's Jeff?",
    "He's sick.     I think he...",
    "I hate you. You know that?     You bastard.",
    "Rudy knew we were going to be there. He never should have come. You want the truth, all this happened cause of you.",
    "Me?",
    "Yeah, you deformed retard! The only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was because of that thing on your face.",
    "Every night, I lie in bed and plan your murder.",
    "I'm shaking.",
    "First I'm going to take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers then your nose then your tongue. Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes with the end of a broomstick. Well, not really poke them out, but I'm gonna push them back into your brain. Then I'm gonna take scissors and cut off your ears. When they find you, it's gonna be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back together.",
    "If you kill me, you come here.",
    "So? What do I have to look forward to? You've already destroyed my life.",
    "What happened was an accident.",
    "There are no accidents. You're gonna pay for what you did. And it's gonna hurt like hell.",
    "What the hell is this?",
    "I'm reading the list of ingredients in our foods.",
    "Why?",
    "Research. Do you know the damage these chemicals can do to the human body?",
    "Leonard, put everything back.",
    "This is serious. You can't keep buying this crap. Don't you care that you're ingesting garbage?",
    "Just put everything back and go to sleep.",
    "How was your week?",
    "Same. Still can't sleep. When I do, nightmares.",
    "Post traumatic stress is very common in your line of work. Many fire fighters go through this.",
    "Yeah. But why now? I haven't fought fires in ten years.",
    "Sometimes we experience something so horrific, our memory blocks it out. That way we won't have to relive the pain. It's called repression. Our bodies are not so forgiving, however. Inside, we feel the effects of trauma even when we don't know why.",
    "What does that mean?",
    "Something stirred your unconscious. If we find out what that was, we can begin the healing process.",
    "You told me last week, the nightmares started about the time you moved here. Let's look at that. Why did you move here?",
    "A friend was making good money with construction. He got an offer to build that extension off Lindsay Acres. He suggested I come into town and work for a while.",
    "Are there any other reoccurring elements in your dreams. Perhaps, a face or...",
    "\"Light my Fire\" is always playing.",
    "What?",
    "Light my fire. The Doors song. \"Da da something... wallow in the mire... Da, da... we couldn't get much higher. Come on baby light my fire.",
    "Interesting.",
    "Dad?",
    "Jacob.",
    "You okay?",
    "Fantastic.",
    "You know, for the past few weeks, I sat in this house. I couldn't move. Everything reminded me of Rudy. Then from out of nowhere I had a revelation. I am alive! Your mother is alive! I became overcome with joy because I realized how lucky we are to still have you.",
    "Me?",
    "Jacob.   I love you.",
    "I went to work today. For the first time in weeks. It was as if I had just gotten out of college! I was fearless! I went after accounts I had avoided for years because I thought they were out of my league. I spoke to presidents, vice presidents, business managers, sales reps. I was amazing. I was magic. But when I came home to share the news with your mother, I discovered her asleep. When I looked around the house, I realized that her \"office\", for lack of a better word, was also piled up. So, I took to the house. I have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom. Even if it takes me all night, I don't care. Jacob?",
    "Yeah?",
    "Will you join me? Join me in this celebration of life. A symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new.",
    "Do I have to?",
    "No, you don't have to.",
    "Good night, Dad.",
    "I'm sure Bette Midler would be most impressed with that rendition.",
    "Anyway, our next soloist is Malee Chung. She will play the theme from \"Love Story\" on the flute.",
    "Thank you, Mr. Farmer.",
    "There's actually been a change. I'm not going to play the theme from \"Love Story\". Um... this is a song...",
    "What? I can't hear you?",
    "Anyway.    This is a song by The Doors.",
    "Where's Jacob?",
    "Couldn't make it. He...",
    "Malee.",
    "Oh my God!     He's coming over.",
    "Who?",
    "Shut up!     Leave now.",
    "You were awesome.",
    "Really? Be honest. I'd rather you tell me I sucked then lie.",
    "You were great.",
    "Excuse me for a second.",
    "Ow, ow, ow alright.    I'm going.",
    "So you really enjoyed it?",
    "Yeah. Good song.      What made you pick it?",
    "Oh, uh... my mother was humming it all last week. Big Doors fan.",
    "Really?   Is she here?",
    "No.",
    "She missed out.",
    "You're so sweet.",
    "Yeah well, I have to go, but thanks again. I had a great time.",
    "That boy is going to bring the entire house down.",
    "Let him be. He's looking good. I'm proud of him.",
    "Girls, have you decided what you're going to go as for Halloween?",
    "Either a witch or a princess.",
    "That's nice. Haley?",
    "I'm going to go as a marble.",
    "What do you mean, a marble?",
    "You know, like a bag of marbles, but just one marble.",
    "I'm really sorry, man.   I...",
    "You just think about what I said. Get out of my sight. And send Kenny in on your way out.",
    "What did you say to him?",
    "I thought you'd both like to know that Halloween was Rudy's favorite holiday.",
    "These are pictures from every single Halloween since we were five. You see how happy he was?",
    "Stop it.",
    "After we'd go trick or treating, we'd sit in our room and swap the candy we hated. Rudy loved Snickers, I Almond Joys.",
    "Almond Joy sucks.",
    "What sucks is that I'll never get to sit in my room and swap candy with my brother ever again. Thanks to you.",
    "Why are you doing this?",
    "To remind you.",
    "How could we forget? You been coming here for months to \"remind us\".",
    "No one is forcing you to talk to me.",
    "Anything to get out of my cell.",
    "Is your cell small?",
    "Yes.",
    "So is a coffin.",
    "You're not the only one who wishes he was still alive. I'd do anything to bring him back, but I can't. It's not easy being in here. Hell, you saw Jeff.",
    "What happened to him?",
    "He pissed off the wrong guy off. Jeff is totally fucked right now.",
    "Good.",
    "Don't come back here ever again.",
    "Free country. I'll come if I want.",
    "Don't expect me to show up.",
    "Be careful now.   Have a good night.",
    "Kids keep coming later every year.",
    "I hate him! I hate him!",
    "Who?    What happened?",
    "Leonard! He threw away all our Halloween candy.",
    "He grabbed our bags and just threw them down a gutter.",
    "What the hell is going on? Why did you throw away their candy?",
    "Because their sugar intake is completely unhealthy. Besides, Halloween is supposed to be a celebration of evil. How did candy get wrapped into it?",
    "I am going to ask you this once, and I want a straight answer. Are you in a cult?",
    "Grace!",
    "This is what happens when kids join cults. The first thing they change is their diets.",
    "I'm not in a cult. This is all information you can find in books.",
    "The issue here is that you have stolen one of the most exciting nights of the year from your sisters.",
    "If anybody had done this to you when you were a child, we never would have heard the end of it.",
    "I wish somebody had done it to me. I wish either one of you had given a shit about my weight.",
    "I do not care for your language.",
    "I'm only trying to help you guys.",
    "You're fat dad. Mom is fat.   Us kids are fat.",
    "What's your point?",
    "Dad, you and mom are going to die young if you keep eating as poorly as you do.",
    "What is this obsession you have with weight?",
    "The coach for Jefferson High is also my gym teacher. He told me that if I got into shape, I could start as center for the Freshman team when I get to high school.",
    "Center is a great position. Toughest guy on the field. A good center can make or break a team.",
    "I know.   That's why I'm trying so hard to get into shape. You guys should to. At the rate you're going, you won't make it to your 60's.",
    "Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares.",
    "She doesn't! Tonight she served spaghetti and meatballs from a can. The amount of sodium alone can wreck havoc on a person's blood pressure. Not to mention...",
    "Leonard, people just don't drop dead from eating meatballs.",
    "I can't take your Halloween candy.",
    "You'll be doing me a favor. Chocolate gives you zits. Besides, if I want to keep this firm ass as an adult, I gotta develop good eating habits now.",
    "Maybe just a snickers.",
    "So work is good?",
    "To be honest, I can't wait till this job is finished. This place is creepy. You know, a boy died here like right before we started working.",
    "Rudy.   His name was Rudy.",
    "You knew him?",
    "He was one of my best friends. Remember that funeral I went to?",
    "That was him?",
    "I thought you knew. Two boys threw a flaming cocktail at him. Can you imagine killing someone like that? How evil can you get?",
    "Jeff Laskey is dead.",
    "What?",
    "He committed suicide in his jail cell last night. Sally Yngve called just now to tell me.",
    "Why are you smiling?    A boy died.",
    "No, a monster that murdered my son died. Justice is served; end of story.",
    "He used his bed sheet, waited until lights out and then jumped.",
    "That's terrible.",
    "His cell mate let him hang there the entire night.",
    "I'm sorry, Kenny.",
    "Like you even give a shit. I bet when you heard, you started dancing.",
    "No.",
    "I knew he wouldn't make it. It's my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint when I met him, but he sure as hell wasn't headed here. That fucking asshole!",
    "An IPOD!   Sweet!",
    "You like it?",
    "I love it.     You guys went crazy this year.",
    "I'm going to shower.",
    "Jim, Jacob still has one more present.",
    "I thought we were going to wait.",
    "No, do it now! Now!",
    "After serious debate, your father and I have decided... to adopt A BABY!",
    "What?",
    "We're gonna adopt a baby. Hopefully a boy.",
    "May I be excused?",
    "No!",
    "Why do I have to do this? It's Christmas break.",
    "You'll be one step ahead in January.",
    "Just because you're an atheist, I don't get to celebrate the holidays.",
    "Don't you find it hard not believing in anything?",
    "Malee.",
    "I'm going for a bike ride.",
    "There's a foot of snow outside.",
    "The streets are ploughed. Besides, I like looking at all the lights.",
    "Be home in an hour. Be careful.",
    "Freeze!   That's right.",
    "Don't worry, white male infants are the hardest to come by. 60 minutes did a whole story on it.",
    "Since when do you watch 60 minutes?",
    "Since I was in the hospital. They said, any adoption agency worth its salt has at least a three year waiting list. By the time your parents get a kid, you'll be in college. You think they'll want to start over again with that baby shit?",
    "No, but it's like they're trying to replace Rudy.",
    "It doesn't matter cause it's not gonna happen.",
    "I'm thirsty. Can you get us some drinks?",
    "Why me?",
    "Because it's the gentlemanly thing to do.",
    "I'll get the drinks.",
    "I'll go with you.",
    "Why are you all of a sudden going to get the drinks?",
    "Because you've upset me, and I don't want to see you right now.",
    "Fine, I'll get the drinks.",
    "I need a favor. It's big. I need you to hide something for me.",
    "Hide what?",
    "Promise, you won't freak.",
    "I won't.",
    "Holy shit!",
    "You said, you wouldn't freak!",
    "That's a gun.",
    "I know.",
    "Where'd you get it?",
    "I can't tell you. I just need you to hide it for a while. When all is cool, I'll come for it.",
    "Why can't you keep it?",
    "My mother is a total snoop. She goes through my stuff like all the time. Please, Jacob. Somebody's life might depend on it.",
    "Is it loaded?",
    "No, but I do have some bullets.",
    "Sure your parents won't find it?",
    "Nobody has the combination, but me. Besides, I could be building a bomb in here, and they wouldn't even know.",
    "I sent in some comics for ya.   The X-men one is pretty sweet.",
    "That last batch was awesome.",
    "I better get going, I don't want to miss my bus.",
    "Before you go, I got some news. Apparently, the parole board feels I've been a model prisoner, so they're giving me early release.",
    "What?   How can they do that?",
    "I don't know. They just did. You're pissed, aren't you? I knew you would be. It was an accident, Jacob.",
    "So you're getting out.   Gonna head back to school, or...",
    "Fuck school. I'm going to live with my Dad in New Mexico. He's working on a ranch out there.",
    "You can't leave the state. That violates your probation. You'll have to...",
    "My dad won't tell anyone. No one will even care I'm out there.",
    "Your mom will.",
    "Jacob, in the entire time I've been locked up, you were the only one who came to see me. Trust me, she won't care.",
    "200 dollars! Dad sent me 200 dollars!",
    "I have to call him.",
    "No! Your father... went out.     He's not home right now.",
    "You're acting weird.     What's going on?",
    "Nothing.",
    "Well, do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it?",
    "I'd prefer it if you'd put that money in the bank. Fine, spend it. You'll have to do it alone though. I have a patient this afternoon. Have a good day.",
    "Here's the deal. You know how my company flies me to Florida every April?",
    "You and I have been going since I was eight. It's the guy's week off.",
    "This year, I'm taking the girls. Just the girls. You're staying home.",
    "Why can't we all go?",
    "I'm not staying here all alone. Besides, you said it yourself, you've been going for years. Give your sisters a chance.",
    "Whatever. I need money.",
    "What for?",
    "Clothes.    Nothing I have fits anymore.",
    "Your father and I aren't rich. You can't get a new wardrobe anytime you want.",
    "What am I supposed to do, go to school naked?",
    "Wear a belt.",
    "I'll give him some cash, he can get some clothes.",
    "No. He's gonna gain all his weight back in a few months.",
    "Then what, we have to buy him new clothes all over again?",
    "Grace.",
    "What?    It's true.",
    "I thought you hated going to Florida?",
    "When I was fat. Now I don't have to wear a T-shirt when I go swimming. Who knows, maybe I could even get lucky.",
    "You're still ugly, though.",
    "I don't understand what my mother's problem is. It's like the thinner I get, the more she hates me.",
    "She's probably jealous. Maybe you should put her on that diet.",
    "Anytime I mention it, my mother goes crazy.",
    "If you really want her to drop a few tons, put her in jail. Kenny's lost about 30 pounds since he's been incarcerated, and he was already thin.",
    "Really?",
    "Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight loss program. You take a fat tub, throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise. Don't let them out till they do.",
    "Malee, dinner!",
    "Malee? Oh my God!",
    "What did you do?",
    "I got a new look. You know, for Spring. What do you think?",
    "You look...",
    "Beautiful?",
    "Different. What happened to your glasses?",
    "Contacts. It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain.",
    "Honey, in the future, I'd like to know if you're going to radically change your appearance. Clean your stuff up and come down for dinner.",
    "Malee?   My God, you look...",
    "Different?",
    "Beautiful.     You look beautiful.",
    "I felt like I needed a change, you know?",
    "I bet you're driving the boys at school wild.",
    "Boys my age are so immature. I'm more attracted to older gentlemen.",
    "You don't want somebody that much older than you. An age difference can cause problems.",
    "What kind of problems?",
    "A lot of times when a couple has an age difference, they wind up splitting up because they want different things.",
    "You mean sex.",
    "No.",
    "I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a boy even three years older than you is probably more \"experienced\". Boys can be impatient about that sort of thing.",
    "Are you impatient?",
    "No, but when I was a kid.",
    "Why don't you have a girlfriend?",
    "I did, but it didn't work out.",
    "How old was she?",
    "About my age.",
    "See that, age wasn't an issue, yet you still wanted different things. I don't think it's about age.",
    "I think when two people connect, they connect for other reasons. And since soulmates are eternal, they have no age.",
    "Have a good flight!",
    "We're home.",
    "Hi.",
    "Could you come downstairs for a minute. We have a surprise for you.",
    "This is Keith Gardner. You're new brother. Keith our son, Jacob.",
    "It's nice to meet you.",
    "You get top bunk.",
    "I'm kind of afraid of heights.",
    "Sucks to be you.",
    "No offence, but I never thought my future brother would be a... well, a \"brother\".",
    "I never thought my future brother would have a KOOL AID stain, smeared across his face.",
    "Fuck you, it's a birthmark!",
    "We're getting off on the wrong foot.",
    "When my parents said they were taking in an orphan, I pictured a baby. So what happened, your parents die or something?",
    "I was given up at birth.",
    "You gonna try and find your mother when you're 18?",
    "As far as I'm concerned, the fact she had me was enough. I don't need to show up one day and disrupt her life.",
    "Oh, but it's okay to just show up one day and disrupt mine?",
    "He's not some baby.   He's like 10.",
    "You're blaming me for this?",
    "No.   But can you believe it?",
    "Maybe this is the only way they can get over Rudy's death.",
    "He's a person not a fucking vase.",
    "I know.",
    "I gotta get out of there. I can't live in that house for one more day. I want to go with you to New Mexico.",
    "No way. You've never even   been out on the road.",
    "So.",
    "It's not easy. After first night falls, you'll be pissing yourself.",
    "No, I won't.",
    "You don't need me to run away from home.",
    "That's not what this is about.",
    "Yes, it is. And you want to come with ME of all people. Are you forgetting, I was the one who killed Rudy!",
    "That was an accident.",
    "I'll be helpful. I can get everything we'll need together. As soon as you're released, we can go.",
    "Please.",
    "If this is what you want.   Alright.",
    "... I'm not asking for much. Just call her from time to time... Because she needs to know her father cares... Call collect.",
    "Is that Dad? Can I talk to him?",
    "Take some responsibility for yourself and grow... Hello?...",
    "He hung up.",
    "Well, what do you expect?   All you ever do is yell at him.",
    "Malee, you don't understand.",
    "He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it bothers you, but I love him. You keep this up then one day, when I'm old enough, I'll leave here and go and stay with him.",
    "Help! Oh God, Ma! Help!",
    "Leonard?",
    "Leonard, what's wrong?",
    "It's on top of me. I can't get up! Oh, there's so much blood!",
    "I'm calling 9-1-1!",
    "Get it off me first! I'm bleeding.",
    "If I go downstairs, I won't be able to make it back up. Let me call 9-1-1 first, okay?",
    "Leonard?",
    "Oh, Jesus!",
    "Leonard?",
    "What the hell?",
    "What are you doing? I can't climb up now!",
    "Leonard!     Leonard!",
    "I hope someone is hungry.",
    "Get me out of here now!",
    "No joke, Ma. For the next two weeks while Dad and the girls are away, you will be kept down here. I'll provide you with nutritious meals and plenty of water. You, mother, will learn what it means to be healthy.",
    "That's what this is about, food?",
    "I'm trying to save your life, mom. Trying to give you a life. Cause I love you.",
    "My life is fine.   I don't need you to \"save me\".",
    "You don't even realize how sick you are. It's a problem when an otherwise healthy woman can't drag her ass up a flight of stairs because she's so obese. You're staying down here.",
    "Oh, and no cigarettes either.",
    "Hello?",
    "What the hell is this?",
    "I made dinner, my love.   And I have a surprise.",
    "You've been in my apartment before, haven't you?",
    "Malee, put your clothes on now!",
    "Don't you like my body?",
    "Malee, stop.",
    "It's okay because I love you.",
    "Touch me.",
    "Where are you going?",
    "To go call your mother.",
    "But we're soulmates.",
    "I don't know what to say to you.",
    "Wanna play some catch?",
    "Where the hell did you get this?",
    "The closet. Ow, what's wrong?",
    "You're hurting me.",
    "Did I say you could play with the glove? Did I?",
    "No, I just...",
    "Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING in this room is mine. You are not allowed to touch a thing, especially the glove.",
    "Okay, okay.",
    "If you tell my parents what I said, I'll kill you. I'll shoot you in the fucking face, I swear it!",
    "What's wrong now?",
    "I was looking at a picture of you and Rudy when you were born. God, I miss him.",
    "But you have Keith now",
    "What the hell does that mean?",
    "You have Keith. Two boys again. Everything is fine.",
    "We didn't adopt Keith to replace Rudy.",
    "Didn't you?",
    "For your information, your father and I discussed adopting for years.",
    "Right. Maybe if it was me who died, you wouldn't need another kid to get over it.",
    "How can you say that? I never wanted either of my children to die.",
    "But one of us did. If you had to choose which one, I bet you wish it was me.",
    "I know you think we favored Rudy...",
    "You did!    Admit it.",
    "I admit he was easier to raise, but we didn't love him more. Jacob, listen to me. You came with a different set of challenges.",
    "My birthmark.",
    "It's not easy being different...",
    "I'm not different!! You always made me feel like something was wrong. There's nothing wrong with me.",
    "I know...",
    "No, you don't! It's like you don't know how to deal with me. You never did.",
    "I'm sorry if that is how you feel. You do the best you can as a parent. You don't always know what's right. But you're my son. I'd do anything for you. I'd fight for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die for you.",
    "Rudy used to say that exact same thing.",
    "It's true. And as unchristian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead. Someday, when you grow up, you'll understand what I mean. Someday.",
    "When Pat calls, and I don't answer, he'll know something is wrong. He'll know. I'll be fine.",
    "Open this door now! Let me out, God damn it! Leonard!",
    "Before we begin, I want to apologize. I should have known what was going on with Malee.",
    "It's my fault. I knew she had a crush on me. I guess, I felt bad for her. She's a very unhappy girl.",
    "If it's any consolation, the whole thing was very \"therapeutic\" for me. Sorry. That was a very selfish thing to say.",
    "This is your therapy. Not mine. Why was it therapeutic?",
    "I slept last night. I can't remember the last time I slept so deep or so sound. I don't remember dreaming or anything.",
    "Why do you think that is?",
    "One of the last fires I ever fought was a brownstone, beautiful. The place was burned from roof to basement. Whole family was wiped out. When I was upstairs, inspecting, I found a girl. She couldn't have been more than 12.",
    "The whole right side of her face was burnt off, but her eyes were open. She was alive. The pain must have been excruciating. She was begging for me to... kill her.",
    "What did you do?",
    "Exactly what she wanted. I placed my hand over her mouth and what was left of her nose, and I... I killed her. I told myself it was the right thing to do, but I've never been sure.",
    "What does this have to do with Malee?",
    "When I saw her last night, she had the same look on her face as that girl. She just wanted me to take away her pain.",
    "Doctor?",
    "Would you mind if we... cut out early today? No charge.",
    "I understand.",
    "Hello?... Daddy!... No, she's not home... Can I ask you something? Can I visit you for a while?... A week... But I can fly alone... No, I understand... Yeah... I love y... Hello?...",
    "Honey?",
    "Why does he hate me?",
    "Leonard!",
    "Leonard, I smell gas!",
    "Leonard, don't you smell that...? Oh God, he can't. Leonard! Leonard, the gas is on!",
    "No!",
    "Leonard, wake up! Leonard!",
    "It's alive!",
    "What happened?",
    "Gas leak.",
    "My mom, she's...",
    "She's fine. They've taken her into surgery. She blew out her knees somehow. We're trying to get your father on the phone right now.",
    "",
    "Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now.",
    "Tonight, we ride.",
    "We got sleeping bags, a tent, canteens and a lantern.",
    "I heard it's supposed to rain, so I'll bring ponchos.",
    "Cool.",
    "You're acting weird.    You gonna chicken out?",
    "No.",
    "You better not. I already packed twice the amount of shit. I can't carry it all alone.",
    "I'll be there.",
    "Good. I'm telling you, man. It's gonna be great.",
    "I guess.",
    "Come on. You can't be a pussy all your life.",
    "I know.",
    "I'll see you tonight.    Don't be late.",
    "Leonard!",
    "I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to leave the gas on. It was an accident. And everything that happened, I... I just thought that maybe, I could help you.",
    "Leonard, my mother died at 52. We had to cremate her body because they didn't make a coffin big enough for her to fit in. Even if they had, no one could have carried it. I loved her so much. I don't want that to happen to me.",
    "It doesn't have to.",
    "Even if I can manage the food... Can you honestly see me, running a marathon?",
    "You don't have to run a marathon. You just have to run to the end of the block. It's not so hard as you think it is.",
    "I'll try.",
    "I spoke to your father. He and the girls caught a flight. They should be here by morning.",
    "Did you tell him what happened?",
    "I told him there was a gas leak.",
    "I meant...",
    "I know what you meant. I didn't tell him. I don't think I will.",
    "You're late.",
    "I'm here.",
    "Put this on.",
    "What the fuck is that?",
    "If people see me riding around in the middle of the night, we're screwed. You didn't bring a disguise?",
    "Who gives a shit what I'm up to.",
    "The main road is this way.",
    "Yeah, but if we cut through the construction site, we'll hit the railroad tracks. It's faster and no one will bother us.",
    "Good point.",
    "What's wrong?",
    "I can't do this.",
    "What?!",
    "Son of a bitch! I knew it.     I knew you'd chicken...",
    "What the fuck?",
    "I can't let you leave, Kenny.     You have to pay for what you did.",
    "Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I... I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll do my probation.",
    "You killed him. I gotta do this... for my family. It's the only way.",
    "Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an accident. I swear. Please, don't. This isn't you.",
    "I know. But I can't be a pussy all my life.",
    "I thought I wasn't supposed to touch this.",
    "You're awake.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It's yours. Just don't leave it outside. If it gets wet, the leather will crack.",
    "I'll take good care of it.   I know this was Rudy's.",
    "Why do you have a gun?",
    "Just a b-b gun. I returned it to a friend of mine. I'm sorry for being such an asshole to ya.",
    "Does this mean we're brothers now?",
    "Yeah. We're brothers.",
    "Gus?",
    "Before you freak out, I want to tell you, I'm sorry. And to give you this.",
    "Malee?",
    "Don't be mad. I was just worried about you. Now I'm out of your life forever. Goodbye. Thanks for not pressing any charges.",
    "Did you change your hair?",
    "No.",
    "You might wanna think about it",
    "Hey, Bianca.",
    "Awesome shoes.",
    "I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school.  Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere.",
    "Any questions?",
    "I don't think so, ma'am",
    "Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got deviants to see.",
    "Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual.",
    "I missed you.",
    "It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.",
    "It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.",
    "With the teeth of your zipper?",
    "You the new guy?",
    "So they tell me...",
    "C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.",
    "So -- which Dakota you from?",
    "North, actually.  How'd you   ?",
    "I was kidding. People actually live there?",
    "Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.",
    "How many people were in your old school?",
    "Thirty-two.",
    "Get out!",
    "How many people go here?",
    "Couple thousand. Most of them evil",
    "We've got your basic beautiful people. Unless they talk to you first, don't bother.",
    "Those 're your cowboys.",
    "That I'm used to.",
    "Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.",
    "To the right, we have the Coffee Kids. Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden movements around them.",
    "And these delusionals are the White Rastae.",
    "Big Marley fans.  Think they're black. Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I mean.",
    "Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?",
    "Michael, my brother, peace",
    "So where do you fit in all this?",
    "Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League, already accepted.  Someday I'll be sipping Merlot while those guys --",
    "are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is back, my friend.",
    "That girl -- I --",
    "You burn, you pine, you perish?",
    "Who is she?",
    "Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it",
    "Why not?",
    "I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.",
    "Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea.  Any other comments? Kat?",
    "Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?",
    "I'm sorry?",
    "This book is about a guy and his fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial topic.",
    "Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats.",
    "As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends?",
    "That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.",
    "I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time",
    "What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir?",
    "Mother Goose?",
    "Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.",
    "Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.",
    "Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.",
    "I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.",
    "The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...",
    "Tempestuous?",
    "No ... I believe \"heinous bitch\" is the term used most often.",
    "You might want to work on that",
    "As always, thank you for your excellent guidance.",
    "I realize the language of Mr. Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, but I'm sure you're all doing your best.",
    "Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far?",
    "Not really.",
    "Mandella -- since you're assisting us, you might as well comment.  I'm assuming you read the assignment.",
    "Uh, yeah, I read it all",
    "The whole play^",
    "The whole folio.  All the plays.",
    "You've read every play by William Shakespeare?",
    "Haven't you?",
    "The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me.",
    "Who's that?",
    "Patrick Verona   Random skid.",
    "That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.",
    "I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.",
    "He always look so",
    "Block E?",
    "Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.",
    "Just a little.",
    "What's this?",
    "An attempted slit.",
    "I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.",
    "But imagine the things he'd say during sex.",
    "Okay, say you do it.  You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there.  Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?",
    "Virgin alert.",
    "Lookin' good, ladies.",
    "Tragic.",
    "Why do girls like that always like guys like that?",
    "Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.",
    "He always have that shit-eating grin?",
    "Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.",
    "You know French?",
    "Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada",
    "Guess who just signed up for a tutor?",
    "You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?",
    "You could consecrate with her, my friend.",
    "The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?",
    "Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.",
    "They're running the rest of me next month.",
    "The people at this school are so incredibly foul.",
    "You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.",
    "Need a ride, ladies?",
    "That's a charming new development",
    "Remove head from sphincter!  Then pedal!",
    "You all right?",
    "Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.",
    "That's her?  Bianca's sister?",
    "The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.",
    "\"Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --\"",
    "In the microwave.",
    "Make anyone cry today?",
    "Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.",
    "Where've you been?",
    "Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.",
    "Hello, precious.",
    "How touching.",
    "What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?",
    "I guess I got in",
    "What's a synonym for throbbing?",
    "Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.",
    "I know.",
    "I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.",
    "You decided.",
    "Is there even a question that we want her to stay?",
    "Ask Bianca who drove her home",
    "Swollen...turgid.",
    "Who drove you home?",
    "Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...",
    "No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.",
    "What if she never starts dating?",
    "Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.",
    "But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!",
    "This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?",
    "Enough!",
    "Do you know what this is?",
    "This is why you're not dating until your sister does.",
    "But she doesn't want to date.",
    "Exactly my point",
    "Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?",
    "Tumescent!",
    "You're not helping.",
    "Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.",
    "Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.",
    "Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?",
    "You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?",
    "Forget it.",
    "No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---",
    "Cameron.",
    "The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.",
    "Seems like she could get a date easy enough...",
    "Why?",
    "Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.",
    "That's a shame.",
    "Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...",
    "Let me see what I can do.",
    "You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you have no concept of the high school social code?",
    "I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.",
    "Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?",
    "What about him?",
    "You wanna go out with him?",
    "No - he could wrangle with the sister.",
    "What makes you think he'll do it?",
    "He seems like he thrives on danger",
    "No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...",
    "They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?",
    "I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.",
    "Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?",
    "Did she actually say she'd go out with you?",
    "That's what I just said",
    "You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.",
    "I thought you hated those people.",
    "Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.",
    "So now all we gotta do is talk to him.",
    "I'll let you handle that.",
    "Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference. Me?  I prefer East African and Indonesian.  You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin' Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I mean?",
    "Hey, there",
    "Later, then.",
    "Hey.",
    "Are you lost?",
    "Nope - just came by to chat",
    "We don't chat.",
    "Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.",
    "We're not.",
    "Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't you?",
    "But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?",
    "Does this conversation have a purpose?",
    "So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.",
    "Exactly",
    "Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will on my part.",
    "I have a dick on my face, don't I?",
    "You got him involved?",
    "Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.",
    "You're one brilliant guy",
    "So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.",
    "William would never have gone to a state school.",
    "William didn't even go to high school",
    "That's never been proven",
    "Neither has his heterosexuality.",
    "I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?",
    "Does it matter?",
    "If I was Bianca, it would be, \"Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara.\"",
    "Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson.",
    "Janice Parker is an idiot",
    "I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?",
    "Touch of the flu.",
    "I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?",
    "How 'bout your sex life?",
    "Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?",
    "What's to discuss?",
    "You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?",
    "Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...",
    "Fine.  Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week.",
    "Look, it's really easy.",
    "You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister.",
    "It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a political figure.  I do not live in South Africa.  My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries.",
    "But you freed our people",
    "Your \"people\" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I have not freed you, Trevor. Only you can free yourself.",
    "C'esc ma tete. This is my head",
    "Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.",
    "I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.",
    "That's because it's such a nice one.",
    "Forget French.",
    "How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?",
    "Well, there's someone I think might be --",
    "Show me",
    "Give me a sign when he walks by.  And don't point.",
    "There.",
    "Where?",
    "I guess he didn't see me Some other time --",
    "My God, he's repulsive. He's so perfect!",
    "What?",
    "Yeah",
    "What do you think?",
    "Two legs, nice rack...",
    "Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.",
    "Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.",
    "You just said",
    "You need money to take a girl out",
    "But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?",
    "Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had the plane.",
    "You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.",
    "You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?",
    "I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.",
    "How much?",
    "I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.",
    "Fine, thirty.",
    "Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.",
    "Fifty, and you've got your man.",
    "Good run, Stratford.",
    "Hey. Girlie.",
    "I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?",
    "Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?",
    "There's a way to get a guy's attention.",
    "My mission in life.",
    "Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked.  The world makes sense again.",
    "Pick you up Friday, then",
    "Oh, right.  Friday.",
    "The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.",
    "Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?",
    "I know a lot more than that",
    "Doubtful.  Very doubtful.",
    "You're no bargain either, sweetheart.",
    "So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt.",
    "He took the bait.",
    "Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility.",
    "I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.",
    "Can you at least start wearing a bra?",
    "Hey",
    "You hate me don't you?",
    "I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.",
    "Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.",
    "And why would I do that?",
    "Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...",
    "You -- covered in my vomit.",
    "Seven-thirty?",
    "Nice ride. Vintage fenders.",
    "Are you following me?",
    "I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.",
    "Hi",
    "You're not a big talker, are you?",
    "Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.",
    "Hey -- do you mind?",
    "Not at all",
    "You fucking bitch!",
    "My insurance does not cover PMS",
    "Then tell them I had a seizure.",
    "Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?",
    "I thought you were punishing me.",
    "Why can't we agree on this?",
    "Because you're making decisions for me.",
    "As a parent, that's my right",
    "So what I want doesn't matter?",
    "You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.",
    "I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --",
    "Christ!  I want a night to go by that I'm not staring a contraction in the face.",
    "When I shell out fifty, I expect results.",
    "I'm on it",
    "Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.",
    "I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.",
    "Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action, I don't get any action.  So get your ass on hers by the end of the week.",
    "I just upped my price",
    "What?",
    "A hundred bucks a date.",
    "Forget it.",
    "Forget her sister, then.",
    "You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona.",
    "La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?",
    "A \"copine\" is someone you can count on. An \"ami\" is someone who makes promises he can't keep.",
    "You got something on your mind?",
    "I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?",
    "You have my word.  As a gentleman",
    "You're sweet.",
    "How do you get your hair to look like that?",
    "Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.",
    "You know, I read an article about that.",
    "You did?",
    "Say it",
    "What?",
    "Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.",
    "We wanted to talk to you about the plan.",
    "What plan?",
    "The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.",
    "What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?",
    "I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.",
    "Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.",
    "That's where we can help you.  With Kat.",
    "So Dorsey can get the girl?",
    "Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.",
    "You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?",
    "We're your guys.",
    "And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.",
    "Yeah -- we'll see.",
    "We're in.",
    "This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.",
    "In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.",
    "Will Bogey get bent?",
    "Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.",
    "Which do you like better?",
    "I think I like the white shirt",
    "It's more",
    "Expensive?",
    "Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?",
    "Hopefully.",
    "Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if you won't be there.",
    "Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's party?",
    "Sure have.",
    "I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.",
    "I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.",
    "She's not a...",
    "Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.",
    "So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?",
    "Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.",
    "All right.  What else is she partial to?",
    "Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.",
    "What've you got for me?",
    "I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.",
    "What?!",
    "Good enough.",
    "Number one.  She hates smokers",
    "It's a lung cancer issue",
    "Her favorite uncle",
    "Dead at forty-one.",
    "Are you telling me I'm a - \"non-smoker\"?",
    "Just for now.",
    "Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys.",
    "What?  You don't think I'm pretty?",
    "He's pretty!",
    "Okay!  I wasn't sure",
    "Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and \"angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion\".",
    "So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?",
    "Ever been to Club Skunk?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.",
    "Don't make me do it, man",
    "Assail your ears for one night.",
    "It's her favorite band.",
    "I also retrieved a list of her most recent CD purchases, courtesy of American Express.",
    "Michael -- did you get this information \"illegally\"?",
    "I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.",
    "I'm likin' you guys better",
    "This is really music?",
    "Can you turn down the Screaming Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.",
    "Don't tell me you're actually going out?  On a school night, no less.",
    "Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?",
    "It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.",
    "Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?",
    "What do you think?",
    "I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.",
    "Let's hit it.",
    "You think this'll work?",
    "No fear.",
    "Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!",
    "I can count.",
    "I'll bet you can..",
    "Go ahead. And you",
    "Yes?",
    "Take it easy on the guys in there.",
    "Next time, leave the Bic at home, Skippy.",
    "It's a bottle opener.",
    "Verona, my man.",
    "Always a pleasure, Brucie.",
    "Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?",
    "Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?",
    "Never",
    "Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?",
    "Just sent 'em through.",
    "Hey -- what happened to that chick you brought last time?  The one with the snake?",
    "Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and we're from Olympia.",
    "Pet my kitty!",
    "Meow",
    "I need agua!",
    "Shit",
    "Two waters.",
    "You're not fooling anyone.",
    "hey.  Great show, huh?",
    "Excuse me?",
    "That's what you want, isn't it?",
    "Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.",
    "You're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke.",
    "I know.  I quit.",
    "Oh, really?",
    "You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.",
    "You know who The Raincoats are?",
    "Why, don't you?",
    "I watched you out there   I've never seen you look like that",
    "Come to that party with me.",
    "What?",
    "I got it, Rick.",
    "Nine-thirty then.",
    "What'd he say?",
    "Who cares?",
    "Has he importun'd you with love in honourable fashion?",
    "Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor of romance.  You're the one that wants to march on Washington every five minutes.",
    "Gigglepuss was so beyond.",
    "They were.  I only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us.",
    "So true.",
    "So, then she says that she almost didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing, you know, genres. And the fact that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here - \"really meant something.\"",
    "You told me that part already.",
    "Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -",
    "Hey.  Dingo Boingo",
    "I hear you're helpin' Verona.",
    "Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*",
    "You and Verona?",
    "What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.",
    "What's your gig in all this?",
    "I'm just the new guy.",
    "You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.",
    "Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?",
    "Is it about me?",
    "You're completely demented.",
    "See you next week!",
    "Dear God, stay away from her.  If you two ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth.",
    "She's obviously not going.",
    "Daddy, I --",
    "And where're you going?",
    "If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.",
    "Otherwise known as an orgy?",
    "It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since \"Gloria Steinem\" over there isn't going --",
    "Do you know about any party? Katarina?",
    "Daddy, people expect me to be there!",
    "If Kat's not going, you're not going.",
    "You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.",
    "What's normal?",
    "Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.",
    "What's a Bogey Lowenstein?",
    "Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?",
    "At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.",
    "Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.",
    "It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?",
    "Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.",
    "Girls",
    "I know about the goddamn party.  I'm going.",
    "Oh, God.  It's starting.",
    "It's just a party. Daddy.",
    "Wear the belly before you go.",
    "Daddy, no!",
    "Just for a minute",
    "I want you to realize the weight of your decisions.",
    "You are so completely unbalanced.",
    "Can we go now?",
    "Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.",
    "Why?",
    "Because she'll scare them away.",
    "Nine-thirty right?",
    "I'm early.",
    "I'm driving.",
    "Who knocked up your sister?",
    "Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the right, shots in the kitchen.",
    "Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat",
    "Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede?",
    "Where ya goin?",
    "Away.",
    "Your sister here?",
    "Leave my sister alone.",
    "And why would I do that?",
    "A fight!",
    "That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.",
    "Just who I was looking for.",
    "",
    "What's this?",
    "\"I'm getting trashed, man.\" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?",
    "I say, do what you wanna do.",
    "Funny, you're the only one",
    "Moose, my man! Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters have already started calling.",
    "Yo, Clem. A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new Leanne Rimes. Ziggy, peace, bra. Prefers a water pipe, but has been known to use a bong.",
    "Follow the love, man",
    "Where did he go?  He was just here.",
    "Who?",
    "Joey.",
    "Evening, ladies.",
    "Hi.",
    "Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?",
    "You know Chastity?",
    "I believe we share an art instructor",
    "Great",
    "Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?",
    "Certainly Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?",
    "Surprise me.",
    "Extremely unfortunate maneuver.",
    "The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?",
    "Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.",
    "No, I ' m not.",
    "She used me!  She wants to go out with Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!",
    "At least you're self-aware",
    "So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig \" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.",
    "Queen Harry?",
    "It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.",
    "Neat...",
    "My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.",
    "I'll be right back.",
    "He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.",
    "Is he oily or dry?",
    "Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...",
    "Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.",
    "Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?",
    "All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.",
    "Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --",
    "I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.",
    "I want another one",
    "My man",
    "It's about time.",
    "A deal's a deal.",
    "How'd you do it?",
    "Do what?",
    "Get her to act like a human",
    "Okay?",
    "I'm fine. I'm",
    "You're not okay.",
    "I just need to lie down for awhile",
    "Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep",
    "I know, just let me sleep",
    "What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...",
    "Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, okay?",
    "C'mon, let's walk",
    "Cameron, I'm a little busy",
    "It's off. The whole thing.",
    "What 're you talking about?",
    "She's partial to Joey, not me",
    "Cameron -- do you like the girl?",
    "Sure",
    "Then, go get her",
    "This is so patronizing.",
    "Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.",
    "Why 're you doing this?",
    "I told you",
    "You don't care if I die",
    "Sure, I do",
    "Why?",
    "Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.",

    "Jesus.  You're like a weeble",
    "Why'd you let him get to you?",
    "Who?",
    "Dorsey.",
    "I hate him.",

    "No. What do they say?",
    "Shit!",

    "I'm gettin' there",
    "The only thing people know about me is that I'm \"scary\".",

    "So you got cozy with she who stings?",
    "No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.",
    "What'd you do to her?",

    "Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway",

    "You didn't have to.  He disrupted a classroom.",
    "But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention.  There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis.",

    "So what's your excuse?",
    "Acting the way we do.",
    "Yes",

    "Why didn't you tell me?",
    "I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.",
    "No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.",
    "That's not",
    "I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.",
    "I guess I thought I was protecting you.",
    "God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself",

    "My grandmother's .",
    "What?",
    "That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.",
    "That ' s completely adorable!",
    "It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?",
    "What's Bianca doing here with that cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let some little punk ass snake me.",
    "Feces hitting fan.  C'mon",
    "Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it easy.",
    "Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.",
    "Very uncool, my brother",
    "I'm not your brother, white boy.",

    "And that's for the fourth grade, asshole.",
    "Wait I...",
    "You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!",
    "It wasn't like that.",
    "Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?",
    "I didn't care about the money.",
    "I cared about --",
    "You are so not what I thought you were.",
    "Are you sure you don't want to come with us?  It'll be fun.",

    "She okay?",
    "I hope so.",
    "Was that your sister?",
    "Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.",
    "Funny.",

    "No, Daddy.",
    "So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?",
    "Parts of it.",
    "Which parts?",
    "The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.",
    "Bianca did what?",
    "What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?",
    "No -- impressed.",
    "You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.",
    "When I go?",
    "Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.",
    "Katarina?",

    "No! I just wanted",
    "Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my office?",
    "So you're the real bitch",
    "Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch. I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could.  Apparently, this makes me a horrible person.  I'm sorry.",
    "I swear -- I didn't know about the money.  I didn't even know Joey was involved.  I would never intentionally hurt you, Kat.",
    "Do you care to respond?",
    "Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?",
    "Just smack her now.",
    "We'll be getting back to you.",

    "Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?",

    "It seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book, so I'm assigning co-counsel. Any volunteers?",
    "No.",
    "Sam.",
    "I have a stack of paper on my desk --",
    "Work with Kaffee on this.",
    "Doing what? Kaffee'll finish this up in four days.",
    "Do various... administrative... you know... things. Back-up. Whatever.",
    "In other words I have no responsibilities whatsoever.",
    "Right.",
    "My kinda case.",
    "Hi. I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to meet with -- -- Commander Galloway.",
    "About a briefing.",
    "You're the attorney that Division assigned?",
    "I'm lead counsel. This is Sam Weinberg.",
    "I have no responsibilities here whatsoever.",
    "Come in, please, have a seat...",
    "Lieutenant, how long have you been in the Navy?",
    "Going on nine months now.",
    "And how long have you been out of law school?",
    "A little over a year.",
    "I see.",
    "Have I done something wrong?",
    "No. It's just that when I petitioned Division to have counsel assigned, I was hoping I'd be taken seriously.",
    "No offense taken, if you were wondering.",
    "Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally considered the best litigator in our office. He's successfully plea bargained 44 cases in nine months.",
    "One more, and I got a set of steak knives.",
    "Have you ever been in a courtroom?",
    "I once had my drivers license suspended.",
    "Danny --",
    "Commander, from what I understand, if this thing goes to court, they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest.",
    "No. They'll need a lawyer.",
    "Dawson's family has been contacted. Downey's closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side, she hasn't been Contacted yet.",
    "Would you like me to take care of that?",
    "Sure, if you feel like it.",
    "One of the people you'll be speaking to down there is the barracks C.O., Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've heard of him.",
    "Who hasn't?",
    "He's been in the papers lately. He's expected to be appointed Director of Operations for the National Security Counsel.",
    "These are letters that Santiago wrote in his 8 months at GITMO --",
    "Guantanamo Bay.",
    "I know that one.",
    "He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody was listening. You with me?",
    "Yes.",
    "This last letter to the Naval investigative Service --",
    "-- where he offers information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort.",
    "Right. Is that all?",
    "Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago.",
    "Gotcha. And Santiago is... who?",
    "The victim.",
    "Write that down. Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay?",
    "Yes, among other --",
    "And am I further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy.",
    "Colonel Jessep, yes, but --",
    "Twelve years.",
    "I'm sorry?",
    "Twelve years. I can get it knocked down to Involuntary Manslaughter. Twelve years.",
    "You haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper.",
    "Pretty impressive, huh?",
    "You're gonna have to go deeper than just --",
    "Commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about?",
    "My job is to make sure you do your job. I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face. Read the letters. You're not under any obligation, but I'd appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba.",
    "Sure.",
    "You're dismissed.",
    "Sorry, I always forget that.",
    "He's a little preoccupied. The team's playing Bethesda Medical next week.",
    "Tell your friend not to get cute down there.  The marines in Guantanimo are fanatical.",
    "About what?",
    "Dear Sir,",
    "About being marines.",
    "\"...My name is PFC William T. Santiago. I am a marine stationed at Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Delta. I am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help. I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill. Then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck. I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. I ask you to help me. Please sir. I just need to be transferred out of RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps.\"",
    "\"P.S. In exchange for my transfer off the base, I'm willing to provide you with information about an illegal fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August 2nd.\"",
    "Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago.",
    "Sir, Santiago is a member of Second Platoon, Delta.",
    "Yeah, well, apparently he's not very happy down here at Shangri-La, cause he's written letters to everyone but Santa Claus asking for a transfer. And now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting.",
    "Matthew?",
    "I'm appalled, sir.",
    "You're appalled? This kid broke the Chain of Command and he ratted on a man of his unit, to say nothing of the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and it would appear that he can't run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's going on over at Windward, Matthew?",
    "Colonel, I think perhaps it would be better to hold this discussion in private.",
    "That won't be necessary, Colonel, I'll handle the situation.",
    "The same way you handled the Curtis Barnes incident? You're doing something wrong, Lieutenant this --",
    "My methods of leadership are --",
    "Don't interrupt me, I'm still your superior officer.",
    "And I'm yours, Matthew.",
    "I want to know what we're gonna do about this.",
    "I think Santiago should be transferred off the base. Right away.",
    "He's that bad, huh?",
    "Not only that, but word of this letter's bound to get out. The kid's gonna get his ass kicked.",
    "Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose you're right. I suppose that's the thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a better idea. Let's transfer the whole squad off the base. Let's -- on second thought -- Windward. The whole Windward division, let's transfer 'em off the base. Jon, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence, they're packing their bags. Tom!",
    "Sir!",
    "Got me the President on the phone, we're surrendering our position in Cuba.",
    "Yes sir!",
    "Wait a minute, Tom.",
    "Don't call the President just yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit balling here -- but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train Santiago. Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals. Yes. I'm certain I once read that somewhere. And now I'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American way. Santiago stays where he is. We're gonna train the lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness report, I'm gonna blame you. Then I'm gonna kill you.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I think that's a mistake, Colonel.",
    "Matthew, I believe I will have that word in private with you now. Jon, that's all. Why don't you and I have lunch at the \"O\" club, we'll talk about the training of young William.",
    "Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear any suggestions you have.",
    "Dismissed.",
    "Matthew, sit, please.",
    "What do you think of Kendrick?",
    "I don't know that --",
    "I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. But he's an awfully good officer, and in the end we see eye to eye on the best way to run a marine corps unit. We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew. That's a responsibility we have to take pretty seriously. And I believe that taking a marine who's not yet up to the job and packing him off to another assignment, puts lives in danger.",
    "Matthew, siddown. We go back a while. We went to the Academy together, we were commissioned together, we did our tours in Vietnam together. But I've been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have. Now if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you, well, I don't give a shit. We're in the business of saving lives, Captain Markinson. Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.",
    "Hal?",
    "Is this Washington, D.C.?",
    "Alright, let's get tough out there!",
    "Excuse me.",
    "You want to suit up? We need all the help we can get.",
    "No, thank you, I can't throw and catch things.",
    "That's okay, neither can they.",
    "I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.",
    "Say again?",
    "Dawson and Downey.",
    "Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but I'm just not --",
    "Dawson! Downey! Your clients!",
    "The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and Downey. Right. I've done something wrong again, haven't I?",
    "I was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball.",
    "We need the practice.",
    "That wasn't funny.",
    "It was a little funny.",
    "Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel?",
    "Why?",
    "I don't think you're fit to handle this defense.",
    "You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense.",
    "Oh come on, that was damn funny.",
    "I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the path of least resistance.",
    "Wow. I'm sexually aroused, Commander.",
    "I don't think your clients murdered anybody.",
    "What are you basing this on?",
    "There was no intent.",
    "The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. Now, I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad.",
    "Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison.",
    "Oh, now I see what you're saying. It had to be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick.",
    "I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.",
    "Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's a big white house with pillars in front.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I don't think you'll have much luck, though. I was assigned by Division, remember? Somebody over there thinks I'm a good lawyer. So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty much handle things myself.",
    "Do you know what a code red is?",
    "What a pity.",
    "Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, sir. Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon, Delta.",
    "Someone hasn't been working and playing well with others, Harold.",
    "Sir, yes sir!",
    "Sir, PFC Louden Downey.",
    "I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinerg, you can sitdown.",
    "Is this your signature?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "You don't have to call me sir. Is this your signature?",
    "Sir, yes sir.",
    "And you certainly don't have to do it twice in one sentence. Harold, what's a Code Red?",
    "Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary engagement.",
    "What does that mean, exactly?",
    "Sir, a marine falls out of line, it's up to the men in his unit to get him back on track.",
    "What's a garden variety Code Red?",
    "Sir?",
    "Harold, you say sir and I turn around and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, Kaffee. Garden variety; typical. What's a basic Code Red?",
    "Sir, a marine has refused to bathe on a regular basis. The men in his squad would give him a G.I. shower.",
    "What's that?",
    "Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel wool...",
    "Beautiful.",
    "Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Do you ever talk?",
    "Sir, Private Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him.",
    "Swell. Private Downey, the rag you stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was there poison on it?",
    "No sir.",
    "Silver polish, turpentine, anti- freeze...",
    "No sir. We were gonna shave his head, sir.",
    "When all of a sudden...?",
    "We saw blood drippinq out of his mouth. Then we pulled the tape off, and there was blood all down his face, sir. That's when Corporal Dawson called the ambulance.",
    "Did anyone see you call the ambulance?",
    "No sir.",
    "Were you there when the ambulance got there?",
    "Yes sir, that's when we were taken under arrest.",
    "On the night of August 2nd, did you fire a shot across the fenceline into Cuba?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Why?",
    "My mirror engaged, sir.",
    "His mirror engaged?",
    "For each American sentry post there's a Cuban counterpart. They're called mirrors. The corporal's claiming that his mirror was about to fire at him.",
    "Santiago's letter to the NIS said you fired illegally. He's saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a move.",
    "Oh, Harold?",
    "You see what I'm getting at? If Santiago didn't have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red?",
    "Because he broke the chain of command, sir.",
    "He what?",
    "He went outside his unit, sir. If he had a problem, he should've spoken to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then Company Commander, then --",
    "Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you assault Santiago with the intent of killing him?",
    "No sir.",
    "What was your intent?",
    "To train him, sir.",
    "Train him to do what?",
    "Train him to think of his unit before himself. To respect the code.",
    "What's the code?",
    "Unit Corps God Country.",
    "I beg your pardon?",
    "Unit Corps God Country, sir.",
    "The Goverrment of the United States wants to charge you two with murder. You want me to go to the prosecutor with unit, corps, god, country?",
    "That's our code, sir.",
    "We'll be back. You guys need anything? Books paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich?",
    "Sir. No thank you. Sir.",
    "Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to.",
    "Sir?",
    "I'm the only friend you've got.",
    "Dan Kaffee.",
    "Sailin' Jack Ross.",
    "Welcome to the big time.",
    "You think so?",
    "I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake you practice law better than you play softball.",
    "Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don't do anything better than I play softball. What are we lookin' at?",
    "They plead guilty to manslaughter, I'll drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll be home in half that time.",
    "I want twelve.",
    "Can't do it.",
    "They called the ambulance, Jack.",
    "I don't care if they called the Avon Lady, they killed a marine.",
    "The rag was tested for poison.  The autopsy, lab report, even the initial E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not.",
    "The Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he's sure.",
    "What do you know about Code Reds?",
    "Oh man.",
    "Are we off the record?",
    "You tell me.",
    "I'm gonna give you the twelve years, but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know this: The platoon commander Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with the men. And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago.",
    "I'll talk to you when I get back.",
    "Hey, we got a little four-on-four going tomorrow night. When does your plane get in?",
    "Hi there.",
    "Any luck getting me replaced?",
    "Is there anyone in this command that you don't either drink or play softball with?",
    "Commander --",
    "Listen, I came to make peace. We started off on the wrong foot. What do you say? Friends?",
    "Look, I don't --",
    "By the way, I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for. The kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't know where he is, he doesn't even know why he's been arrested.",
    "Commander --",
    "You can call me Joanne.",
    "Joanne --",
    "or Jo.",
    "Jo?",
    "Yes.",
    "Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine again without my permission, I'll have you disbarred. Friends?",
    "I had authorization.",
    "From where?",
    "Downey's closest living relative, Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side.",
    "You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?",
    "I gave her a call like you asked. Very nice woman, we talked for about an hour.",
    "You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.",
    "Perfectly within my province.",
    "Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can hold the trial there. I can sew the costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge.",
    "I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.",
    "And the hits just keep on comin'.",
    "How's it goin', Luther?",
    "Another day, another dollar, captain.",
    "You gotta play 'em as they lay, Luther.",
    "What comes around, goes around, you know what I'm sayin'.",
    "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.",
    "Hey, if you've got your health, you got everything.",
    "Love makes the world go round. I'll see you tomorrow, Luther.",
    "When Nancy gets back, you're my witness. The baby spoke. My daughter said a word.",
    "Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm not sure it was a word.",
    "Oh come on, it was a word.",
    "Okay.",
    "You heard her. The girl sat here, pointed, and said \"Pa\". She did. She said \"Pa\".",
    "She was pointing at a doorknob.",
    "That's right. Pointing, as if to say, \"Pa, look, a doorknob\".",
    "Jack Ross came to see me today. He offered me twelve years.",
    "That's what you wanted.",
    "I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean -- I'll take it.",
    "So?",
    "It took albout 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight.",
    "Danny, take the twelve years, it's a gift.",
    "You don't believe their story, do you? You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives.",
    "I believe every word they said. And I think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives.",
    "I'll see you tomorrow.",
    "Remember to wear your whites, it's hot down there.",
    "I don't like the whites.",
    "Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba in August. You got Dramamine?",
    "Dramamine keeps you cool?",
    "Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get sick when you fly.",
    "I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll help.",
    "I've got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good.",
    "Yeah, right.",
    "You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left. He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch Santiago.",
    "So?",
    "I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is. What the hell. I'll see you tomorrow.",
    "Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Commander Galloway.",
    "I'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, I'm to escort you to the Windward side of the base.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I've got some camouflage jackets in the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll have to ask you both to put them on.",
    "Camouflage jackets?",
    "Regulations, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline. The Cubans see an officer wearing white, they think it's someone they might wanna take a shot at.",
    "Good call, Sam.",
    "We'll just hop on the ferry and be over there in no time.",
    "Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?!",
    "Yes sir, to get to the other side of the bay.",
    "Nobody said anything about a boat.",
    "Is there a problem, sir?",
    "No. No problem. I'm just not that crazy about boats, that's all.",
    "Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy for cryin' out loud!",
    "Nobody likes her very much.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Nathan Jessep, come on in and siddown.",
    "Thank you. I'm Daniel Kaffee, I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey. This is Joanne Galloway, she's observing and evaluating --",
    "Colonel.",
    "Pleased to meet you, Commander.",
    "Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility here whatsoever.",
    "I've asked Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick to join us.",
    "Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of seeing your father once. I was a teenager and he spoke at my high school.",
    "Lionel Kaffee?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Well what do you know. Son, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods. Jefferson vs. Madison County School District. The folks down there said a little black girl couldn't go to an all white school, Lionel Kaffee said we'll just see about that. How the hell is your dad?",
    "He passed away seven years ago, colonel.",
    "Well... don't I feel like the fuckin, asshole.",
    "Not at all, sir.",
    "Well, what can we do for you, Danny.",
    "Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid. This is really a formality more than anything else. The JAG Corps insists that I interview all the relevant witnesses.",
    "The JAG Corps can be demanding that way.",
    "Jonanthan'll take you out and show you what you wanna see, then we can all hook up for lunch, how does that sound?",
    "Fine, sir.",
    "I understand you had a meeting with your men that afternoon.",
    "Yes.",
    "What'd you guys talk about?",
    "I told the men that there was an informer among us. And that despite any desire they might have to seek retribution, Private Santiago was not to be harmed in any way.",
    "What time was that meeting?",
    "Sixteen-hundred.",
    "Four o'clock.",
    "Sam, somebody should see about getting this stuff to his parents. We don't need it anymore.",
    "Actually, the uniforms belong to the marine corps.",
    "Lt. Kendrick -- can I call you Jon?",
    "No, you may not.",
    "Have I done something to offend you?",
    "No, I like all you Navy boys. Every time we've gotta go someplace and fight, you fellas always give us a ride.",
    "Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered?",
    "Commander, I believe in God, and in his son Jesus Christ, and because I do, I can say this: Private Santiago is dead and that's a tragedy. But he's dead because he had no code. He's dead because he had no honor. And God was watching.",
    "How do you feel about that theory?",
    "Sounds good. Let's move on.",
    "You planning on doing any investigating or are you just gonna take the guided tour?",
    "I'm pacing myself.",
    "...And they spent the next three hours running around, looking for Americans to surrender to.",
    "That was delicious, men, thank you.",
    "Our pleasure, sir.",
    "Colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about August 6th.",
    "Shoot.",
    "On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an NIS angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting.",
    "Yes.",
    "Santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer. An I getting this right?",
    "Yes.",
    "If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, you should free to speak up.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Now it was at this point that you called Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick into your office?",
    "Yes.",
    "And what happened then?",
    "We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off the base.",
    "Santiago was set to be transferred?",
    "On the first available flight to the states. Six the next morning. Three hours too late as it turned out.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Alright, that's all I have. Thanks very much for your time.",
    "The corporal's got the jeep outside, he'll take you back to the airstrip.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Wait a minute, I've got some questions.",
    "No you don't.",
    "Yes I do.",
    "No you don't.",
    "Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five?",
    "Jo --",
    "Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead.",
    "See? The man was dead. Let's go.",
    "I was wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red.",
    "Jo --",
    "I've heard the term, yes.",
    "Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers.",
    "I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave it its due attention. What's your point, Jo?",
    "She has no point. She often has no point. It's part of her charm. We're outta here. Thank you.",
    "My point is that I think code reds still go on down here. Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel?",
    "Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that.",
    "Yes he does.",
    "No, he really doesn't.",
    "Yeah, he really does. Colonel?",
    "You know it just hit me. She outranks you, Danny.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "I want to tell you something Danny and listen up 'cause I mean this: You're the luckiest man in the world. There is, believe me gentlemen, nothing sexier on earth than a woman you have to salute in the morning. Promote 'em all I say.",
    "Colonel, the practice of code Reds is still condoned by officers on this base, isn't it?",
    "You see my problem is, of course, that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have to keep taking cold showers 'til they elect some gal President.",
    "I need an answer to my question, sir.",
    "Take caution in your tone, Commander. I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy. You want to know about code reds? On the record I tell you that I discourage the practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me. So don't for one second think you're gonna come down here, flash a badge, and make me nervous.",
    "Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order.",
    "What's that?",
    "Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paper work on that kind of thing, I just need it for the file.",
    "For the file.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order. For the file. I'm here to help anyway I can.",
    "Thank you.",
    "You believe that, don't you? Danny? That I'm here to help anyway I can?",
    "Of course.",
    "The corporal'll run you by Ordinance on your way out to the airstrip. You can have all the transfer orders you want.",
    "Let's go.",
    "But you have to ask me nicely.",
    "I beg your pardon?",
    "You have to ask me nicely. You see, Danny, I can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood. I can deal with the heat and the stress and the fear. I don't want money and I don't want medals. What I want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white uniform, and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fuckin' courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely.",
    "Colonel Jessep... if it's not too much trouble, I'd like a copy of the transfer order. Sir.",
    "No problem.",
    "I hate casualties, Matthew. There are casualties even in victory. A marine smothers a grenade and saves his platoon, that marine's a hero. The foundation of the unit, the fabric of this base, the spirit of the Corps, they are things worth fighting for.",
    "Dawson and Downey, they don't know it, but they're smothering a grenade.",
    "Who is it?",
    "It's me.",
    "I've really missed you, Jo. I was just saying to myself, \"It's been almost three hours since I last saw -- \"",
    "Markinson resigned his commission.",
    "When?",
    "This afternoon. Sometime after we left.",
    "I'll talk to him in the morning.",
    "I already tried, I can't find him.",
    "You tried? Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation.",
    "I'm Louden Downey's attorney.",
    "Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like she's known me for years. I suggested that she might feel more comfortable if I were directly involved with the case. She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago.",
    "I suppose it's way too much to hope that you're just making this up to bother me.",
    "Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a motion for separation, you're still lead counsel.",
    "Splendid.",
    "I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red. So do you.",
    "Officer on deck, ten hut.",
    "Did Kendrick order the code red?",
    "Sir?",
    "Don't say sir like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine. You heard what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order you guys to give Santiago a code red?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Did he?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "You mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before?",
    "You didn't ask us, sir.",
    "Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a place in my heart, corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail.",
    "Yes sir. I know you do, sir.",
    "Fuck you, Harold.",
    "Alright. Let's sort this out. There was a platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon. And Lt. Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to Santiago. Now is that true? I want you to speak freely.",
    "Ma'am, that's correct. But then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms.",
    "And what happened then?",
    "Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.",
    "When?",
    "About five minutes after the meeting broke, sir. About 16:20.",
    "And what happened then?",
    "Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.",
    "Jack!",
    "Jack!!",
    "Hang on...",
    "They were given an order.",
    "How long have you known about the order?",
    "I didn't -- Who is this?",
    "This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you.",
    "What exactly are you accusing me of, commander?",
    "I'm accusing you of --",
    "Jack didn't know about the order. Because if he did and he hadn't told us, Jack knows he'd be violating about 14 articles of the code of ethics. As it is, he's got enough to worry about. God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for the record that they were given an order.",
    "Kendrick specifically told the men not to touch Santiago.",
    "That's right. And then he went into Dawson and Downey's room and specifically told them to give him a code red.",
    "That's not what Kendrick said.",
    "Kendrick's lying.",
    "You have proof?",
    "I have the defendants.",
    "And I have 23 marines who aren't accused of murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.",
    "Why did Markinson resign his commission?",
    "We'll never know.",
    "You don't think I can subpoena Markinson.",
    "You can try, but you won't find him. You know what Markinson did for the first 17 of his 21 years in the corps? Counter Intelligence. Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson.",
    "Jessep's star is on the rise. Division'll give me a lot of room to spare Jessep and the corps any embarrassment.",
    "How much room?",
    "I'll knock it all down to assault. Two years. They're home in six months.",
    "No deal, we're going to a jury.",
    "Jo --",
    "No you're not.",
    "Why not?",
    "'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows it. And he knows that if we go to court, I'll have to go all the way, they'll be charged with the whole truckload. Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct Unbecoming, and even though he's got me by the balls out here, Dan knows that in a courtroom, he loses this case. Danny's an awfully talented lawyer, and he's not about to send his clients go to jail for life when he knows they could be home in six months.",
    "That's the end of this negotiation. From this moment, we're on the record. I'll see tomorrow morning at the arraignment.",
    "Here's the story: The Goverment's offering Assault and Conduct Unbecoming. Two years. You'll be home in six months.",
    "\"Wow, Kaffee, you're the greatest lawyer in the world. How can we ever thank you?\" Fellas, you hear what I just said, you're going home in six months.",
    "I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.",
    "Do what?",
    "Make a deal, sir.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "We did nothing wrong, sir. We did our job. If that has consequences, then I accept them. But'I won't say I'm guilty, sir.",
    "Did you -- Did she put you up to this?",
    "No.",
    "We have a code, sir.",
    "Well zippity-doo-dah. You and your code plead not guilty and you'll be in jail for the rest of your life. Do what I'm telling you and you'll be home in six months.",
    "Do it, Harold. Six months. It's nothing. It's a hockey season.",
    "Permission to --",
    "Speak!",
    "What do we do then, sir?",
    "When?",
    "After six months. We'd be dishonorably discharged, right sir?",
    "Yes.",
    "What do we do then, sir? We joined the corps 'cause we wanted to live our lives by a certain code. And we found it in the corps. And now you're asking us to sign a piece of paper that says we have no honor. You're asking us to say we're not marines. If a judge and jury decide that what we did was wrong, I'll accept whatever punishment they give. But I believe I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my job. And I won't dishonor myself, my unit, or the Corps, so that I can qo home in six months. Sir.",
    "Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute.",
    "Let's go in another room. Louden, everything's gonna be alright.",
    "We're gonna go into a holding room.",
    "You don't like me that much, do you? Forget it, don't answer that, it doesn't matter.",
    "You know, Downey worships you. He's gonna do whatever you do. Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code? Harold?",
    "Do you think we were right?",
    "It doesn't matter what I --",
    "Do you think we were right?",
    "I think you'd lose.",
    "You're such a coward, I can't believe they let you wear a uniform.",
    "I'm not gonna feel responsible for this, Harold. I did everything I could. You're going to Levenworth for the better part of your life, and you know what? I don't give a shit.",
    "M.P.!",
    "What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?",
    "Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business. I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way down. I want to get him a new lawyer. How do I do it?",
    "You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment. The judge'll ask you if you want to enter a plea. You tell him you want new counsel assigned.",
    "Then that's that.",
    "Yeah. One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely.",
    "What do you want from me?",
    "I want you to let 'em be judged! I want you to stand up and make an argument!",
    "An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai, an argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremberg.",
    "For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis.",
    "Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument.",
    "Yeah. Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new attorney.",
    "Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? Were daddy's expectations really that high?",
    "Please, spare me the psycho-babble father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll have their day in court, but they'll have it with another lawyer.",
    "Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win. You know they have a case. And you know how to win. You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate.",
    "Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.",
    "Do you believe they have a defense?",
    "You and Dawson both live in the same dreamland. It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove. So please don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law.",
    "You know nothing about the law. You're a used car salesman, Daniel. You're an ambulance chaser with a rank. You're nothing. Live with that.",
    "...So I told duncan if we leverage the acquisition of Biotech, the interrogatories would be there on demand. All I have to do is not pick up the phone and it'll run Flaherty ten thousand a day in court costs.",
    "All rise.",
    "Where are we?",
    "Docket number 411275. VR-5. United States versus Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson and Private First Class Loudon Downey. Defendants are charged with Conspiracy to Commit Murder, Murder in the First Degree, and Conduct Unbecoming a United States Marine.",
    "Does defense wish to enter a plea?",
    "Yeah. They're not guilty.",
    "Enter a plea of not guilty for the defendants. We'll adjourn until ten- hundred, three weeks from today, at which time this Court will reconvene as a General Court-Martial.",
    "Why does a junior grade with six months experience and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder case? Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom?",
    "We'll work out of my apartment. Every night, seven o'clock. Jo, before you come over tonight, pick up a carton of legal pads, a half-dozen boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes of black pens. Sam get a couple of desk lamps. I need you to start on a preliminary medical profile and Jo, we need all the fitness reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The only thing I have to eat is Yoo-Hoo and SugarSnacks, so if you want anything else, bring it with you. Okay?",
    "Yeah.",
    "So this is what a courtroom looks like.",
    "Were you able to speak to your friend at NIS?",
    "She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found, we're not gonna find him. She said I could be Markinson and you wouldn't know it.",
    "Are you Markinson?",
    "No.",
    "Well, I'm not Markinson, that's two down.",
    "What.",
    "I was wondering, now that Joanne's working on this... I was wondering if you still need me.",
    "They were following an order, Sam.",
    "An illegal order.",
    "You think Dawson and Downey know it was an illegal order?",
    "It doesn't matter if they know, any decent human being would've refused to --",
    "They're not permitted to question orders.",
    "Then what's the secret? What are the magic words? I give orders every day, and nobody follows them.",
    "We have softball games and marching bands. They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot.",
    "I need you. You're better at research than I am and you know how to prepare a witness.",
    "I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first.",
    "Did you get any dumplings?",
    "This is our defense. Intent: No one can prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red: They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order: A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no choice but to follow it. That's it.",
    "What about motive?",
    "We're a little weak on motive. They had one.",
    "Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean --",
    "Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up. For now we start here -- I don't know what made Santiago die, I don't want to know. I just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let's start prepping for Stone.",
    "As long as we're on the subject of the doctor --",
    "Here we go.",
    "Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison? The doctor's covering up the truth.",
    "Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the \"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire\" defense. We can't prove coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information.",
    "Cartons 3 and 4.",
    "No Cliff-Notes on these things?",
    "Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander Galloway, I'm an internal affairs officer with the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. I'm trying to track down a Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson, USMC...",
    "Doctor, other than the rope marks, was there any other sign of external damage?",
    "No.",
    "No scrapes?",
    "No.",
    "No cuts?",
    "He resigned his commission a week ago Thursday.",
    "Bruises? Broken bones?",
    "No.",
    "No, please don't put me on hold --",
    "Doctor, was there any sign of violence?",
    "You mean other than the dead body?",
    "Fuck!! I walk into that every goddam time!",
    "Don't ask the last question.",
    "Lt. Kendrick, the type of disciplinary action, or \"training'' as you say --",
    "Object.",
    "Please the Court, I maintain that nothing could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example of, among others, the witness.",
    "Nice.",
    "And what happened after Kendrick came into your room?",
    "He ordered me and Corporal Dawson to give Willy a Code Red.",
    "His answers still have to come faster, Jo. The Iowa farmboy thing'll play for a while, but in the end it looks like he's searching for the truth.",
    "He's right, and from now on, \"Willy\" is Private Santiago. You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him.",
    "Poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the jury. Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head, don't shift in your seat, don't scribble furiously. Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew was gonna happen. When you pass me documents --",
    "And don't wear that perfume in Court, it wrecks my concentration.",
    "Really!",
    "I was talking to Sam.",
    "What time is it?",
    "Time to go home. Try to get some sleep tonight.",
    "I'll give you a ride.",
    "You're a good man, Charlie Brown.",
    "See you in court.",
    "Danny --",
    "I know what you're gonna say. You don't have to. We've had our differences. I've said some things I didn't mean, you've said some things you didn't means but you're happy that I stuck with the case. And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didn't have before, well, of course I'm happy about that, but we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it. You like me. I won't make you say it.",
    "I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow.",
    "Oh. Okay. Good tip.",
    "We're ready.",
    "Bet your ass.",
    "We're gonna get creamed.",
    "Lieutenant Kaffee?",
    "You're gonna save our son, aren't you?",
    "I'll do my best.",
    "Danny, I want you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.",
    "You're Aunt Ginny?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "I'm sorry, I was expecting someone older.",
    "So was I.",
    "Last chance. I'll flip you for it.",
    "All rise.",
    "Too late.",
    "All those having business with this general court-martial, stand forward and you shall be heard. Captain Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding. God save the United States of America.",
    "No objection, your honor.",
    "No objection.",
    "Is the Government prepared to make an opening statement?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill. Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed.",
    "Lt. Kaffee?",
    "There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true. When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Let me say that again: It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags. Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job.",
    "Is the Government ready to call its first witness?",
    "Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C McGuire.",
    "How you doin'?",
    "Good.",
    "Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please?",
    "Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service.",
    "Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year?",
    "We did.",
    "What did the letter say?",
    "That a member of Private Santiago's unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline.",
    "Was that marine identified in the letter?",
    "No sir. I notified the barracks C.O., Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming down to investigate.",
    "And what did you find?",
    "For the shift reported, only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing.",
    "And who was that?",
    "Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.",
    "Your witness.",
    "Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting?",
    "Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy.",
    "But you don't believe him.",
    "It's not my place --",
    "Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause?",
    "There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. You had Willy Santiago's letter.",
    "Santiago was the only witness, but I never had a chance to interview him. So I don't know what he saw.",
    "And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr. McGuire?",
    "No.",
    "No more questions.",
    "Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker, Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Charlie.",
    "Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lt. Kendrick held on the afternoon of August 6th with the members of second platoon.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Would you tell the Court the substance of that meeting?",
    "Lt. Kendrick told us that we had an informer in our group.  That Private Santiago had gone outside the chain of command and reported to the NIS on a member of our platoon.",
    "Did that make you mad? You can tell the truth, corporal, it's alright. Did it make you mad?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "How mad?",
    "Private Santiago betrayed a code that we believe in very deeply, sir.",
    "Were the other members of the squad angry?",
    "Object --",
    "Were Dawson and Downey?",
    "Please the Court, is the judge advocate honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on August 6th?",
    "Sustained.",
    "Corporal, did Lt. Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "What was it?",
    "Well it was clear that he didn't want us to take matters into our own hands, sir.",
    "What was the order?",
    "Sir, he said that Santiago wasn't to be touched.",
    "Your witness.",
    "Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks room ten minutes after this meeting?",
    "No sir.",
    "Thanks, I have no more questions.",
    "The Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas --",
    "Please the Court, I understand Lt. Ross is planning on calling all the other members of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify.",
    "In light of the defense that Lt. Kaffee is planning to mount, the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems particularly relevant testimony.",
    "The defense is willing to concede that all 23 witnesses will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did, if the Government is willing to concede that none of them were in Dawson and Downey's room at 16:20 on August 6th.",
    "Lieutenant?",
    "The Government'll agree to the stipulation, sir.",
    "Then we'll adjourn for the day. You can call your next witness in the morning.",
    "...And he was pronounced dead at zero-zero-thirty-seven.",
    "Dr. Stone, what's lactic acidosis?",
    "If the muscles and other cells of the body burn sugar instead of oxygen, lactic acid is produced. That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.",
    "How long does it take for the muscles and other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar?",
    "Twenty to thirty minutes.",
    "And what caused Santiago's muscles and other cells to start burning sugar?",
    "An ingested poison of some kind.",
    "Your Honor, we object at this point. The witness is speculating.",
    "Commander Stone is an expert medical witness, in this courtroom his opinion isn't considered speculation.",
    "Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist, and the medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive.",
    "A point which I'm confident you'll illustrate to the jury under cross- examination, so I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now.",
    "Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn.",
    "Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning?",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison?",
    "Yes I am.",
    "Then how do you justify --",
    "There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable, both in the human body and on a fabric. The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor in this issue.",
    "Thank you, sir.",
    "Commander, you testified that it takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal.",
    "Yes.",
    "Let me ask you, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis dramatically?",
    "Commander, is it possible?",
    "Certainly.",
    "What might some of those conditions be?",
    "If a person had a coronary disorder... or a cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid.",
    "Commander, if I had a coronary condition, and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out?",
    "It would have to be a very serious condition.",
    "Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam?",
    "Possibly. There would still be symptoms though.",
    "What kind of symptoms?",
    "There are hundreds of symptoms of a --",
    "Chest pains?",
    "Yes.",
    "Shortness of breath?",
    "Yes.",
    "Fatigue?",
    "Of course.",
    "Doctor, is this your signature?",
    "Yes it is.",
    "This in an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty. Would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page, please, sir.",
    "\"Initial testing negative. Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week.\"",
    "Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical reaction?",
    "No. I personally give the men a physical examination every three months. And every three months Private Santiago got a clean bill of health.",
    "And that's why it had to be, poison, right, Commander? 'Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died from a heart related incident, you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, doctor?",
    "Object. Move to strike.",
    "Sustained. Strike it.",
    "No more questions, judge.",
    "Dr. Stone, you've held a license to practice medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000 men. In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?",
    "Your Honor, we re-new our objection to Commander Stone's testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record. And we further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witness's testimony.",
    "The objection's overruled, counsel.",
    "Sir, the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection.",
    "The objection of the defense has been heard and overruled.",
    "Exception.",
    "Noted. The witness is an expert and the court will hear his opinion.",
    "Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?",
    "Yes.",
    "Thank you, sir, I have no more questions.",
    "Commander, you may step down.",
    "Please the Court, while we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses if the need arises, the Government rests.",
    "We'll stand in recess until ten- hundred hours this Monday, the l9th at which time the defense will call it's first witness.",
    "Ten hut.",
    "I strenuously object? Is that how it works? Objection. Overruled. No, no, no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, well if you strenuously object, let me take a moment to reconsider.",
    "I got it on the record.",
    "You also got it in the jury's head that we're afraid of the doctor. You object once so they can hear you say he's not a criminologist. You keep after it and it looks like this great cross we did was just a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks. It's the difference between paper law and trial --",
    "Sam --",
    "Christ, you even had the Judge saying Stone was an expert!",
    "Sam, she made a mistake. Let's not relive it.",
    "I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll meet you tonight.",
    "Why do you hate them so much?",
    "They beat up on a weakling, and that's all they did. The rest is just smokefilled coffee-house crap. They tortured and tormented a weaker kid. They didn't like him. And they killed him. And why? Because he couldn't run very fast.",
    "Alright. Everybody take the night off.",
    "I apologize, I, --",
    "It's alright. We've been working 20 hour days for three and a half weeks straight. Take the night off. Go see your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do whatever it is you do when you're not here. What day is tomorrow?",
    "Saturday.",
    "We'll start at ten.",
    "Why do you like them so much?",
    "'Cause they stand on a wall. And they say \"Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight. Not on my watch.\"",
    "Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday.",
    "I'm sorry to bother you, I should've called first.",
    "No, I was just watching a baseball game.",
    "I was wondering if -- how you'd feel about my taking you to dinner tonight.",
    "Jo, are you asking me out on a date?",
    "No.",
    "It sounded like you were asking me out on a date.",
    "I wasn't.",
    "I've been asked out on dates before, and that's what it sounded like.",
    "Do you like seafood? I know a good seafood place.",
    "My third case was a Drunk and Disorderly. The trial lasted nine weeks. I rounded up 31 people who were in the bar that night.",
    "Nine weeks on a D and D? What was the prosecutor offering?",
    "15 days.",
    "Well, you sure hustled the shit outta him.",
    "After that, they moved me to internal affairs.",
    "Tough to blame them.",
    "Where I've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation.",
    "Why are you always giving me your resume?",
    "Because I want you to think I'm good lawyer.",
    "I do.",
    "No you don't. I think you're an exceptional lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you.",
    "Jo... I think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose. Ross's opening speech, it was all true. I mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order. We can't prove it ever happened. We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder.",
    "We'll find Markinson.",
    "Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna lose huge.",
    "Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
    "Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red?",
    "Being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run...",
    "Have you ever received a code red?",
    "Yes sir. We were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped. It's just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and I'd forgot to use the resin like we were taught.",
    "And what happened?",
    "That night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes. Then they poured glue on my hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I ain't never dropped my weapon since.",
    "Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Was his barracks ever in disorder?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Did he ever fall back on a run?",
    "All the time, sir.",
    "Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red?",
    "No sir.",
    "Never?",
    "No, sir.",
    "You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?",
    "Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.",
    "Dawson wouldn't allow it.",
    "The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him. They were too afraid of Dawson, sir.",
    "Object. The witness is characterizing.",
    "I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Why didn't you?",
    "'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir.",
    "Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some questions now.",
    "Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with this book?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Have you read it?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Good. Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please.",
    "Sir?",
    "Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds.",
    "Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we use -- it's just used down at GITMO, sir. I don't know if it actually --",
    "We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct?",
    "No sir.",
    "No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds?",
    "No sir. No books, sir.",
    "No further questions.",
    "Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted men's mess hall is?",
    "Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir.",
    "I don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book?",
    "I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time, sir.",
    "No more questions.",
    "Corporal Howard, you can step down.",
    "Thank you, sir.",
    "Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review. I want to slam- dunk this guy.",
    "Hey, Luther.",
    "Admiral, how's the big case goin'?",
    "Nose to the grindstone.",
    "No flies on you.",
    "A rolling stone gathers no moss.",
    "Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat lady sings.",
    "Ain't that the truth. Catch you tomorrow.",
    "It's Matthew Markinson.",
    "Jesus fucking Christ!!--",
    "You left the door unlocked.",
    "Scared the shit outta me.",
    "Drive.",
    "Are you aware you're under subpoena?",
    "Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands. If there was something I could do about that, I would, but since I can't, all I can do is help you. Why don't you drive, Lieutenant.",
    "What do you know?",
    "I know everything.",
    "Was it a code red?",
    "Yes.",
    "Did Kendrick give the order?",
    "Yes.",
    "Did you witness it?",
    "I didn't need to --",
    "Did you witness it?!",
    "No.",
    "Then how do you know?",
    "I know.",
    "You know shit.",
    "He was never gonna be transferred off the base.",
    "Jessep was going to keep him on the base. He said he wanted him trained.",
    "We've got the transfer order. It's got your signature.",
    "I know. I signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba. Six days after Santiago died.",
    "I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind of immunity with the prosecutor. In about four days, you're gonna appear as a witness for the defense, and you're gonna tell the court exactly what you told me. Right now I'm gonna check you into a motel, and we're gonna start from the beginning.",
    "I don't want a deal. And I don't want immunity.",
    "I want you to know, I'm proud neither of what I've done nor what I'm doing.",
    "Where is he?",
    "The Route 23 Best Western.",
    "I want him guarded.",
    "That's probably a good idea.",
    "This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. My clearance code is 411273.",
    "Clearance code?",
    "Thank you.",
    "I don't have a clearance code. Do you have a --",
    "It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness.",
    "He also said that Jessep's lying about the transportation off the base. Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier.",
    "Damn.",
    "That was impressive. Did you hear what I just said about the flight?",
    "Yes.",
    "Sam, when a plane takes off from a base, there's gotta be some kind of record kept, right?",
    "We need the Tower Chief's Log for",
    "Get it.",
    "We're gonna win.",
    "Jo, don't get crazy about this. We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the log book's gonna say. You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are.",
    "\"Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's got his case now.\"",
    "You are like seven of the strangest women I have ever met.",
    "That was nice work today. The redirect on Howard.",
    "I have Markinson.",
    "Where is he?",
    "A motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal Marshals outside his door. Take a sip of your drink.",
    "Damn.",
    "The transfer order that Parkinson signed is phoney. And Jessep's statement that the six a.m. flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log. But in the meantime I'm gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun.",
    "I have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to Court-Martial for professional misconduct. And that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer.",
    "Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you that I think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane. And this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something.",
    "Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform. I'm your friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, I don't think your clients belong in jail. But I don't get to make that decision. I represent the Government of the United States. Without passion or prejudice. And my client has a case. I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence.",
    "I've been so advised.",
    "You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny. By everyone. By Dawson, by Galloway, shit, I practically dared you. Not for a second have you believed you could win. You got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer.",
    "You're a lousy softball player, Jack.",
    "Your boys are going down. I can't stop it anymore.",
    "Batter up, J.J.",
    "Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good marine?",
    "I'd say he was about average.",
    "Lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports on Santiago. On all three reports you indicated a rating of Below Average.",
    "Yes. Private Santiago was Below Average I didn't see the need in trampling on a man's grave.",
    "We appreciate that, but you're under oath now, and I think unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth.",
    "I'm aware of my oath.",
    "Lieutenant, these are the last three fitness reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey received three straight marks of Exceptional. Dawson received two marks of Exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated June 9th of this year, he received a rating of Below Average. It's this last report that I'd like to discuss for a moment.",
    "That's fine.",
    "Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after Infantry Training School was perfect. Records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while Dawson has remained a lance corporal. Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last fitness report.",
    "I'm sure it was.",
    "Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report?",
    "I'm sure I don't. I have many men in my charge, Lieutenant, I write many fitness reports.",
    "Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officer's Club?",
    "Yes.",
    "Did you report private Barnes to the proper authorities?",
    "I have two books at my bedside, Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct and the King James Bible. The only proper authorities I'm aware of are my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan R. Jessep and the Lord our God.",
    "Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority.",
    "Objection. Argumentative.",
    "Sustained. Watch yourself, counselor.",
    "Did you report Private Barnes to your superiors?",
    "I remember thinking very highly of Private Barnes, and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge.",
    "You preferred it to be handled within the unit.",
    "I most certainly did.",
    "Lieutenant, do you know what a Code Red is?",
    "Yes I do.",
    "Have you ever ordered a code red?",
    "No, I have not.",
    "Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days?",
    "That's a distortion of the truth. Private Barnes was placed on barracks restriction. He was given water and vitamin supplements, and I assure you that at no time was his health in danger.",
    "I'm sure it was lovely for Private Barnes, but you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you? And you did order the denial of food.",
    "Yes.",
    "Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a code red?",
    "Not necessarily.",
    "If I called the other 8000 men at Guantanamo Bay to testify, would they consider it a Code Red?",
    "Please the court, the witness can't possibly testify as to what 8000 other men would say. We object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness.",
    "The Government's objection is sustained, Lt. Kaffee, and I would remind you that you're now questioning marine officer with an impeccable service record.",
    "Thank you judge.",
    "Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of Below Average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to Private Barnes? Not so fast. Lieutenant?",
    "Corporal Dawson was found to be Below Average because he committed a crime.",
    "What crime did he commit? Lieutenant Kendrick? Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit?",
    "He disobeyed an order.",
    "And because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right?",
    "Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.",
    "Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable. Lt. Kendrick? Can he? Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow?",
    "No, he can not.",
    "A lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes incident, am I right?",
    "I would think so.",
    "You know so, don't you, Lieutenant.",
    "Object!",
    "Sustained.",
    "Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question: if you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red...",
    "-- please the court --",
    "I told those men not to touch Santiago.",
    "-- is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again?",
    "Lieutenant, don't answer that.",
    "You don't have to, I'm through.",
    "Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red?",
    "Lt. Kendrick, did you --",
    "No I did not.",
    "Thank you.",
    "What's the word?",
    "This is the tower chief's log for that night. Jessep was telling the truth. The six a.m. flight was the first plane out.",
    "Let me see that.",
    "Workin' late, lieutenant?",
    "There was no flight out at eleven o'clock. What the fuck are you trying to pull?",
    "The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, at a few minutes past two.",
    "Then why the hell isn't it listed in the Tower Chief's log?!",
    "Why the hell did you think it would be?!!",
    "What are you telling me? He fixed the log book?",
    "Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can sure as hall prove that one landed. I'll get the log book from Andrews.",
    "He made an entire flight disappear?",
    "Nathan Jessep is about to be named Director of Operations for the National Security Council. You don't get to that position without knowing how to side-step a few land mines. And putting me on the stand isn't gonna make him step on one.",
    "You're taking the stand. Thursday.",
    "There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight. A ground crew member. Someone.",
    "Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day? A kid from the ground crew isn't gonna remember a flight that landed four weeks ago.",
    "Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson on the stand and we'll deal with Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago and he'll testify to the forged transfer order. That'll be enough. That and Downey's testimony really oughta be enough.",
    "Private Downey, why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th?",
    "To give Private Santiago a Code Red, ma'am.",
    "And why did you give him a Code Red?",
    "I was ordered to give him a Code Red by the Executive officer for Rifle Security Company Windward, Lieutenent Jonathan James Kendrick.",
    "You're gonna do fine.",
    "You think they'll let us go back to our platoon soon, ma'am?",
    "Absolutely.",
    "You remember the order of the questions?",
    "Yes.",
    "Are you sure?",
    "Yes.",
    "And you'll use small words?",
    "Yes.",
    "He gets rattled when he doesn't understand something.",
    "Jo --",
    "I'm just saying go slow.",
    "I'm gonna go slow.",
    "Okay.",
    "Alright.",
    "And get him off as fast as you can.",
    "Joanne!",
    "What?",
    "He's gonna be fine.",
    "\"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago...\"",
    "I was William's company commander. I knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name...",
    "In a matter of time, the trial of the two man charged with your son's death will be concluded, and seven men and two women whom you've never met will try to offer you an explanation as to why William is dead. For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light.",
    "And the truth is this: your son is dead for only one reason. I wasn't strong enough to stop it.",
    "Always, Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson.",
    "United states marine corps.",
    "Private, I want you to tell us one last time: Why did you go into Private Santiago's room on the night of August 6th?",
    "A code red was ordered by my platoon commander, Lt. Jonathan James Kendrick.",
    "Thank you. Your witness.",
    "Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch log has you down at Post 39, is that correct?",
    "I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that log pretty good.",
    "How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward barracks?",
    "It's a ways, sir, it's a hike.",
    "About how far by jeep?",
    "About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.",
    "Have you ever had to walk it?",
    "Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what we call the fella who drops us at our posts and picks us up... also, 'cause he can get girls in New York City -- the Pick-up Private got a flat...",
    "...Right at 39. He pulled up and blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. The two of us had to double-time it back to the barracks.",
    "And if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am I right?",
    "Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, sir.",
    "Not bad. Now you say your assault on Private Santiago was the result of an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in your barracks room at 16:20.",
    "Yes sir.",
    "But you just said that you didn't make it back to Windward Barracks until 16:45.",
    "Sir?",
    "If you didn't make it back to your barracks until 16:45, then how could you be in your room at 16:20?",
    "You see sir, there was a flat tire.",
    "Private, did you ever actually hear Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?",
    "No, sir.",
    "Please the court, I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client.",
    "Why did you go into Santiago's room?",
    "The witness has rights.",
    "The witness has been read his rights, commander.",
    "Hal?",
    "The question will be repeated.",
    "Why did you go into Santiago's room?",
    "Your honor --",
    "Hal?",
    "Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it?",
    "He did, didn't he? Dawson told you to give Santiago a code red.",
    "Hal?",
    "Don't look at him.",
    "Hal?",
    "Private. Answer the Lieutenant's question.",
    "Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order by my squad leader, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine Corps. And I followed it.",
    "Where do you think he is?",
    "As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick. It didn't matter that he didn't hear it first hand. He doesn't distinguish between the two.",
    "Danny. I'm sorry.",
    "Don't worry about it.",
    "Sam and I were just talking about how all we really have to do is call some witnesses who'll talk about implied orders... or maybe we put Downey back on the stand before we get to Dawson.",
    "Maybe if we work at it we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination.",
    "Are you drunk?",
    "Pretty much. Yeah.",
    "I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a long night's work ahead.",
    "She's gonna make coffee. That's nice. He wasn't in his room. He wasn't even there. That was an important piece of information, don't you think?",
    "Danny, it was just a setback. I'm sorry. But we'll fix it and then move on to Markinson.",
    "Markinson's dead.",
    "You really gotta hand it to those Federal Marshals, boy. It's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife. This guy got, into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room, drew a nickle plated pistol from his holster, and fired a bullet into his mouth.",
    "Anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.",
    "I still think we can win.",
    "Then maybe you should drink a little.",
    "Look, we'll go to Randolph in the morning and make a motion for a continuance. 24 hours.",
    "Why would we want to do that?",
    "To subpoena Colonel Jessep.",
    "What?",
    "Listen for a second --",
    "No.",
    "Just hear me out --",
    "No. I won't listen to you and I won't hear you out. Your passion is comforting, Jo. It's also useless. Private Downey needed a trial lawyer today.",
    "You chicken-shit. You're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up.",
    "It's over!",
    "Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order?",
    "What are you --",
    "In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order?",
    "What does it matter --",
    "Why?!",
    "I wanted the damn transfer order!",
    "Bullshit! You could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order. You had an instinct. And it was confirmed by Markinson. Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing!",
    "What possible good could come from putting Jessep on the stand?",
    "He told Kendrick to order the Code Red.",
    "He did?! Why didn't you say so!? That's qreat! And of course you have proof of that.",
    "I --",
    "Ah, I keep forgetting: You were sick the day they taught law at law school.",
    "You put him on the stand and you get it from him!",
    "Yes. No problem. We get it from him. Colonel, isn't it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?",
    "Look, we're all a little --",
    "I'm sorry, your time's run out. What do we have for the losers, Judge? Well, for our defendants it's a lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee? That's right -- it's -- a court -- martial. Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt. Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Columbo School for Women. Thank you for playing \"Should We or Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of the Galacticly Stupid\".",
    "I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives.",
    "Stop cleaning up.",
    "Sam. Stop cleaning up.",
    "You want a drink?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Is your father proud of you?",
    "Don't do this to yourself.",
    "I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives. \"Sam, made Law Review. He's got a big case he's making -- He's arguing making an argument.\" I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school. I think he would've liked that... an awful lot.",
    "Did I ever tell you that I wrote a paper on your father in college?",
    "Yeah?",
    "He was one of the best trial lawyers ever.",
    "Yes he was.",
    "And if I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, I'd take you any day of the week and twice on Sunday. You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick.",
    "Would you put Jessep on the stand?",
    "No.",
    "You think my father would've?",
    "With the evidence we've got? Not in a million years. But here's the thing -- and there's really no way of getting around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So there's only one question. What would you do?",
    "Joanne.",
    "Jo, we look ridiculous. Stop the car.",
    "Joanne.",
    "I apologize. I was angry and... I'm sorry about what I said.",
    "I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand.",
    "I say we hit him with the phoney transfer order.",
    "What's the transfer order without a witness?",
    "We have a witness.",
    "A dead witness.",
    "And in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem.",
    "Look at this. Last night he was swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.",
    "I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. Both of you.",
    "Good. Jessep told Kendrick to order a code red. Kendrick did, and our clients followed the order. The cover-up isn't our case. To win, Jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the code red.",
    "And you think you can got him to just say it?",
    "I think he wants to say it. I think he's pissed off that he's gotta hide from us. I think he wants to say that he made a command decision and that's the end of it. He eats breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill him, and no one's gonna tell him how to run his base. Least of all the pushy broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard clown. I need to shake him and put him on the defensive.",
    "That's it? That's the plan?",
    "That's the plan.",
    "You're gonna trip Jessep and he's gonna confess.",
    "I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna lead him right where he's dying to go.",
    "And how are you gonna do that?",
    "I have no idea. I need my bat.",
    "What?",
    "I need my bat. I think better with my bat. Where's my bat?",
    "I put it in the closet.",
    "You put it in the closet.",
    "I was tripping over it.",
    "Don't ever put a bat in a closet.",
    "He thinks better with his bat?",
    "I can understand that. I used to have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I could never do my home work without him.",
    "Stay here, I'm going to the office for a while.",
    "Boy, he does think better with that bat.",
    "Sam. I need you to do something.",
    "What's goin' on?",
    "I've gotta go out to Andrews.",
    "Is Sam here?",
    "Not yet.",
    "Where is he?",
    "He's on his way.",
    "Did he got the guys?",
    "Yes. Listen, can I talk to you for a second?",
    "How're you feeling?",
    "I think he's gonna have his hands full today.",
    "Listen. Danny. When you're out there. If it's not gonna happen he's not gonna say it ...don't go for it.",
    "If you feel like... if you feel like... You could get in trouble. I'm special counsel for internal affairs, and I'm telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble.",
    "Why Lt. Commander Galloway... are you suggesting I back off a material witness?",
    "If you think you can't get him. Yeah.",
    "Do you think I can get him?",
    "I think it doesn't matter what I think. I'm an administrator. I can't seem to defend people.",
    "You're my hero, Joanne. From the first day, you were a lawyer. Live with that.",
    "All rise.",
    "Call your witness.",
    "Where's Sam?",
    "He'll be here.",
    "Lieutenant, call your witness.",
    "Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.",
    "Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this General Court-Martial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?",
    "Yes I do.",
    "Would you state your name, rank, and current billet for the record please, air?",
    "Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
    "Thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please.",
    "Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right?",
    "Yes.",
    "The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson.",
    "Yes.",
    "And at present, Captain Markinson is dead, is that right?",
    "Objection. I'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying?",
    "I'm implying simply that, at present, Captain Markinson is not alive.",
    "Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information.",
    "I just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a .45 caliber pistol.",
    "The witness is aware, the Court is aware, and now the jury is aware. We thank you for bringing this to our attention. Move on Lieutenant.",
    "Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick an order, is that right?",
    "I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched.",
    "And did you give an order to Captain Markinson as well?",
    "I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately.",
    "Why?",
    "I felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out.",
    "Grave danger?",
    "Is there another kind?",
    "We have the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning. Was that the first flight off the bass?",
    "The six a.m. flight was the first flight off the base.",
    "Colonel, you flew up to Washington early this morning, is that right?",
    "Yes.",
    "I notice you're wearing your Class A appearance in dress uniform for court today.",
    "As are you, Lieutenant.",
    "Did you wear that uniform on the plane?",
    "Please the Court, is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular?",
    "The defense didn't have an opportunity to depose this witness, your honor. I'd ask the Court for a little latitude.",
    "A very little latitude.",
    "Colonel?",
    "I wore fatigues on the plane.",
    "And you brought your dress uniform with you.",
    "Yes.",
    "And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? Change of underwear?",
    "Your honor.",
    "Is the Colonel's underwear a matter of national security?",
    "Gentlemen. You better get somewhere fast with this, Lieutenant.",
    "Yes sir. Colonel?",
    "I brought a change of clothes and some personal items.",
    "Thank you.",
    "After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth, Santiago's barracks room was sealed off and its contents inventoried. Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2 pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki tee-shirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater --",
    "Please the Court, is there a question anywhere in our future?",
    "Lt. Kaffee, I have to --",
    "I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed.",
    "I'll tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute.",
    "This is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls.",
    "I've highlighted those calls in yellow. Do you recognize those numbers?",
    "I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him know I'd be in town. The second call was to set up a meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee, and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth.",
    "Why did you make that call, sir?",
    "I thought she might like to have dinner tonight.",
    "Judge --",
    "I'm gonna put a stop to this now.",
    "Your honor, these are the telephone records from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer. Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that? The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel.",
    "Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies.",
    "Overruled.",
    "Your honor --",
    "The objection's noted.",
    "Colonel?",
    "Is this funny, sir?",
    "No. It's not. It's tragic.",
    "Do you have an answer?",
    "Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago.  What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer? Phone calls and footlockers? Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill. Do you have any other questions for me, counselor?",
    "Lt. Kaffee?",
    "Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?",
    "Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.",
    "Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you.",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "I'm not through with my examination. Sit down.",
    "Colonel.",
    "What's that?",
    "I'd appreciate it if he addressed me as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've earned it.",
    "Defense counsel will address the witness as Colonel or Sir.",
    "I don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here.",
    "And the witness will address this Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm quite certain I've earned it. Take your seat, Colonel.",
    "What would you like to discuss now! My favorite color?",
    "Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first one off the base?",
    "Yes.",
    "There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a.m.?",
    "Lieutenant, I think we've covered this, haven't we?",
    "Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base. The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\".",
    "I don't understand. You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed?",
    "We believe it did, sir. then motioning to Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. They were working the ground crew at Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.",
    "Your Honor, these men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination.",
    "I'll allow the witnesses.",
    "This is ridiculous.",
    "Colonel, a moment ago --",
    "Check the Tower Logs for christ's sake.",
    "We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir. A moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to touch Santiago.",
    "That's right.",
    "And Kendrick was clear on what you wanted?",
    "Crystal.",
    "Any chance Kendrick ignored the order?",
    "Ignored the order?",
    "Any chance he just forgot about it?",
    "No.",
    "Any chance Kendrick left your office and said, \"The 'old man's wrong\"?",
    "No.",
    "When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him?",
    "Have you ever spent time in an infantry unit, son?",
    "No sir.",
    "Ever served in a forward area?",
    "No sir.",
    "Ever put your life in another man's hands, ask him to put his life in yours?",
    "No sir.",
    "We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die. It's that simple. Are we clear?",
    "Yes sir.",
    "Are we clear?",
    "Crystal.",
    "Colonel, I have just one more question before I call Airman O'Malley and Airman Perez: If you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders are always followed, then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?",
    "Private Santiago was a sub-standard marine. He was being transferred off the base because --",
    "But that's not what you said. You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.",
    "Yes. That's correct, but --",
    "You said, \"He was in danger\". I said, \"Grave danger\". You said --",
    "Yes, I recall what --",
    "I can have the Court Reporter read back your --",
    "I know what I said. I don't need it read back to me like I'm a damn --",
    "Then why the two orders? Colonel? Why did you --",
    "Sometimes men take matters into their own hands.",
    "No sir. You made it clear just a moment ago that your men never take matters into their own hands. Your men follow orders or people die. So Santiago shouldn't have been in any danger at all, should he have, Colonel?",
    "You little bastard.",
    "Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess to --",
    "I'd like an answer to the question, Judge.",
    "The Court'll wait for answer.",
    "If Kendrick told his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched, then why did he have to be transferred?",
    "Colonel?",
    "Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't he? Because that's what you told Kendrick to do.",
    "Object!",
    "Counsel.",
    "And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose.",
    "Your Honor --",
    "That'll be all, counsel.",
    "You had Markinson sign a phony transfer order --",
    "Judge --",
    "You doctored the log books.",
    "Damnit Kaffee!!",
    "I'll ask for the forth time. You ordered --",
    "You want answers?",
    "I think I'm entitled to them.",
    "You want answers?!",
    "I want the truth.",
    "You can't handle the truth!",
    "Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.",
    "Did you order the code red?",
    "I did the job you sent me to do.",
    "Did you order the code red?",
    "You're goddamn right I did.",
    "Please the court, I suggest the jury be dismissed so that we can move to an immediate Article 39a Session. The witness has rights.",
    "Lt. Ross?",
    "Jack.",
    "The Sergeant at Arms will take the jury to an ante-room where you'll wait until further instruction.",
    "What the hell's going on?",
    "Captain, what the hell's going on? I did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm getting on a plane and going back to my base.",
    "M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.",
    "Guard the prisoner.",
    "What the hell --",
    "Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent. Any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceeding. You have the right...",
    "I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- that's what this is -- Marine! Marine!! I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- that's what's happening? This -- I'm -- this is funny, you know that, this is --",
    "I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine.",
    "Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights as I have just read then to you?",
    "I saved lives. That boy was -- there was a weak link. I saved lives, you hear me?",
    "You fuckin' people. You have no idea how to defend a nation. All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That's all you did. You put people in danger. Sweet dreams, son.",
    "Don't call me son. I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the United States Navy. And you're under arrest you sonofabitch.",
    "The witness is excused.",
    "Ten-hut.",
    "Have the jurors reached a verdict?",
    "We have, sir.",
    "On the charge of Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty.",
    "On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty.",
    "On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming a United States Marine, the members find the defendants Guilty as Charged.",
    "The defendants are hereby sentenced by this court to time already served, and are ordered...",
    "...And are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the marine corps. This Court-Martial is adjourned.",
    "Ten hut.",
    "Dismissed.",
    "Why?",
    "Harold, I'm sorry.",
    "Why?!",
    "I don't understand. Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red.",
    "I know, but --",
    "Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red, what did we do wrong?",
    "It's not as simple as --",
    "What did we do wrong?",
    "We did nothing wrong.",
    "Yes you did! A jury just said your conduct was unbecoming a marine. What does that mean?!",
    "You're the lawyer.",
    "You're the marine.",
    "Not anymore.",
    "I never meant to hurt Willy.",
    "Kaffee, I've gotta take these guys over to personnel for some paper work.",

    "Ten-hut.",
    "There's an officer on deck.",
    "Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez? What exactly were these guys gonna testify to?",
    "Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna testify, under oath, that they have absolutely no recollection of anything.",
    "Strong witnesses.",
    "And very handsome, too, don't you think?",
    "I'll see you around the campus. I've gotta go arrest Kendrick.",
    "Tell him I say \"Hi\".",
    "Will do.",
    "Oh, good morning, Dr. Floyd. I'm Nick Miller.",
    "How do you do, Mr. Miller?",
    "I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.",
    "Oh, please don't worry about it.",
    "Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.",
    "Please, it really doesn't matter.",
    "Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?",

    "We all have regrets.",
    "Why's it have to be that way?",
    "Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Can't hurt to ask. You never know who's listening, Michael.",
    "How did you know...",
    "...What are you doing, Dad?",
    "Hey, Guys.     I was just talking to-",
    "Never mind. Sorry I'm late. You ready to get some dinner then?",
    "Why are you limping?",
    "Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron.",
    "I bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start.",
    "Yeah, me and the guys are running drills, scrimmaging, getting in shape.",
    "That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are-",
    "-it's how big you play.",
    "And what about you, Mags?   What's new?",
    "Nothing.",
    "She got into Georgetown.",
    "You did!?    That's fantastic!",
    "It's no big deal.",
    "It's a huge deal. That's a great university. I'm proud of you. Am I missing something here?",
    "You wouldn't understand.",
    "Try me.",
    "I have a lot of emotional stress right now. My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure...",
    "That's not stress. Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski...",
    "Did you get the promotion, Dad?",
    "Still waiting to hear.",
    "Is your mom home?",
    "She's probably out back.",
    "Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound good?",
    "I'm counting down the minutes.",
    "What's with her?",
    "We see you once a week for a couple hours. What do you expect?",
    "Hey, Mike. Good to see you.    Tough break, you and Scarlet.",
    "Bite me, Dom.",
    "A little late for a delivery isn't it?",
    "Dom was in the neighborhood. He offered to make a dump run for me.",
    "Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?",
    "What's your point?",
    "Come on. He's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now.",
    "At least someone's after me.",
    "`In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt I'm after you.'",
    "Please, Mike. This isn't high school. That's not gonna work.",
    "`Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd, and I'm hungry like the wolf.'",

    "Why are you destroying the yard?",
    "I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. Thanks for asking.",
    "Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?",
    "I am a landscape designer. Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that's a fair question.",
    "I didn't get it.",
    "I'm sorry. But maybe this is what you needed. Maybe it's time you looked for something else?",
    "That's a great idea, Scar. Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma.",
    "And it's all my fault, isn't it?",
    "I didn't say that.",
    "No, but it's what you think, right?",
    "I never asked you to marry me.",
    "But I did.",
    "I'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike, really, I am, but you're not the victim here.",
    "Jesus!",
    "Hey!?     Get away from there!?",
    "Oh no!!   Hello!?",
    "What the-",
    "Damn it. Ed! Ed! I lost my key!",
    "Coming!   I've been worried sick! WHERE-",
    "I've had a really rough night.",
    "AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!",
    "Don't come any closer!    I'll use it!",
    "What are you gonna do? Exfoliate me to death? You got into my samples case again, didn't you?",
    "What's your problem, it's only mud.",
    "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!",
    "AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!",
    "I'm dreaming right? Is this some kind of hallucination?",
    "Do something! Anything!    Pinch me!",
    "I said pinch!",
    "Calm down! We need to talk!     We can work this out!",
    "Aye dios mio!",
    "Maria, we're just friends.   Really.",
    "My theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements. I've recreated the exact contents of the LA River. The toxic pollutants, the contaminants.",
    "Well, it obviously isn't working.",
    "That's because the cocktail's not complete.",
    "Last night we had the worst electrical storm of the last hundred years.",
    "Is that true?",
    "It was pretty bad.",
    "Wait!! Wait!! Wait!! Do you really think this'll work?",
    "It could.",
    "Oops. Came unplugged. Won't be a moment.",
    "What were you doing by the river anyway?",
    "The janitor!",
    "Has anyone seen the janitor? Is the janitor here? Where's the janitor?",
    "Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you tell me where I can find the night janitor?",
    "I'm the only custodial engineer currently employed here.",
    "There was an old guy, white hair. I showed him this picture of me-",
    "-Of you?   That picture's from 1989.",
    "Right.   Forget it.",
    "Can I get a little help in here?",
    "Alex?   What are you doing up there?",
    "I wanted to see if I could get my nuts into my esophagus. What do you think I'm doing!? Get me down!",
    "Okay.   Okay. I'll get you down.",
    "How do you know my name?",
    "I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle Ed's son. He told me to look out for you.",
    "Uncle Ed has a son?",
    "Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too. Did those guys do this to you?",
    "Goons from the basketball team.",
    "But why?",
    "Because they can and so they do on a daily basis.",
    "But you're one of them.",
    "No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta go.",
    "Did you find the janitor?",
    "He doesn't exist.   Nothing makes sense.",
    "Did he ask you for your soul?",
    "No?",
    "That's a good sign. We can eliminate Satan. I think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment. \"Spell affect\"...\"casting procedure\"...yada, yada, yada. Basically it's a learning spell. There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid. My guess is that janitor was probably a war...",
    "...I'm going back to high school.",
    "...lock. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Because I thought you just said you were-",
    "Going back to high school.",
    "Are you out of your freaking mind!?",
    "My son was hanging by his underwear from a bathroom stall door and my daughter was being mauled by a smarmy gorilla. They need me.",
    "What about your job?",
    "Email and telephone.   I got it covered.",
    "Well, Scarlet, then.   What are you gonna tell her?",
    "Nothing.",
    "You're just gonna disappear?",
    "To be honest, I think she'd rather have it that way. What's with the attitude?",
    "Because I know you're going to suck me into this and I'm not going back there, Mike. You'll never get me to go back to Fitch. Never!",
    "I hate you.",
    "Take a deep breath. All you have to do is enroll me and say as little as possible.",
    "Are you sure these look legit?",
    "Please. I created software used to launch the space shuttle. I think I'm capable of forging some report cards. What's up with the gear?",
    "This is hip teenage apparel. I got it right off the mannequin at Ed Hardy.",
    "Ms. Goodwin will see you now.",
    "First sign this old hag is on to us I'M-",
    "-so glad we chose this school.   I'm Ed Freedman.",
    "Nice to meet you. I'm Julie Goodwin, principal here at Fitch Senior High. And you behind there? You are?",
    "Oh, right. Sorry. This little chicken pock here is Mark. Say hello, Mark.",
    "Nice to meet you, Julie.",
    "Around here you're going to have to use Ms. Goodwin. Please, sit.",
    "Before we get started I want you to know that Mark's a bastard.",
    "Excuse me!?",
    "I had him out of wedlock.   So the answer is yes, I'm very single...and very rich.",
    "Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a very successful prostitute.",
    "O-Kay. Did you bring your transcripts?",
    "So the last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut. And you were a straight A student. Very impressive.",
    "I help him with his homework...a lot.",
    "Oh, dad, the doctor called.     You were right. It is herpes.",
    "I think it's time we got Mark to class. Lisa! Lisa!",
    "Lisa, will you print out a schedule for Mark and show him to class?",
    "Sure.   Come on, Mark.",
    "Be a good boy now.   And sit up straight.",
    "They grow up so fast. Mojito?",
    "I beg your pardon.",
    "You strike me as a Mojito gal. I know this little Cuban place, great PLANTAINS-",
    "-Yeah, no. I don't date my students' parents. It's a rule of mine.",
    "I'll enroll him somewhere else.",
    "I really need to get back to work.",
    "See you at the next bake sale then?",
    "Do their mothers know they dress like that?",
    "Those are the Wonder Bras.    Beware.",
    "What did you did do? Mug the mannequin at the Ed Hardy store?",
    "Tool!",
    "Oh thank God he's not here.    I ran all the way from-",
    "Why's that freak waving at me.",
    "Take your seats. Stop the talking.",
    "Here are yesterday's tests.    Let's see how you all did.",
    "C-, C, B-, D, D-, F",
    "D for O'Donnell.",
    "Let me guess. Early acceptance? Where are we going?",
    "Georgetown.",
    "If you flunk senior calculus you'll be lucky to get into beauty school, missy. So, if you plan on slacking your way through my class, don't. Save your parents tuition money and pick up a blow dryer...",
    "Enough!",
    "Excuse me?",
    "Do you think humiliating a 17 year- old in front of her peers is helpful or do you just get off on it?",
    "And you are?",
    "Mark Freedman. It's my first day.",
    "Well, Mr. Freedman-",
    "-you've earned yourself a trip to the principal's office. Welcome to Fitch.",
    "Is someone barbecuing? YYYYEEEEOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!",
    "Get out, Mr. Freedman!",
    "Go Hot Pants! Do your dance, Girl!",
    "Look, we feel your pain. We really do. But life's hard enough, Brother.",
    "What's the big deal? He stuck up for me in class. It was a nice thing to do.",
    "He was totally sexing on you.",
    "He's coming. Pretend you're not here.",
    "Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls.     I'm Mark-",
    "Girls?    Hello? Anyone home?",
    "Oh my God.     Can't you see we're not here?",
    "Good.    So there's plenty of room then.",
    "Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch.",
    "Look, this table is V.I.P.     You're a NIP.",
    "What's a NIP?",
    "Not Important. Go away.",
    "Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls?",
    "Listen, I appreciate what you did in class but, I already have a boyfriend.",
    "You have a boyfriend? Excuse me a second.",
    "He still gets calls.    How 2007.",
    "I think my grandfather has that phone.",
    "Maggie, could we talk somewhere ELSE-",
    "Yo!",
    "Bro-ski, what are you doing at our table?",
    "Nothing.   He was just leaving.",
    "We should do this again sometime.",
    "Get your hands off her, you little punk!",
    "You gotta problem with me, `bra?",
    "No, no, I don't.",
    "Now make like Tom and Cruise.",
    "That was so not cool.",
    "What? I'll buy you another ice cream.",
    "It was terrible. The place is evil, Ed. That building needs to be exorcised.",
    "Come on. It couldn't have been that bad.",
    "My beanbag was lit on fire, videoed and sent to every member of student body.",
    "Yeah, I caught it on youtube. Funny stuff.",
    "They mocked my clothes and phone. My daughter got a tongue bath in front of me and I have mint chip in my ears.",
    "High school's great, isn't it?",
    "What can I get you?",
    "Double scotch neat.",
    "Funny, kid.",
    "Get the boy a Shirley Temple. Extra cherries.",
    "I'm not going back there.",
    "Mike, you're an adult sitting on 36 years of experience. You should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out.",
    "I know why you're encouraging me all of a sudden.",
    "Because I'm a supportive dad.",
    "Because you want to nail my principal.",
    "Did she ask about me?",
    "She's not your type. She's smart.",
    "As far as I can tell that's her only flaw. I need a reason to see her again. You could flunk your classes, start a fight, vandalise the place. You'll figure it out. Then I can rush in, a teary eyed, helpless, single dad who can't handle his angry, kitten killing son. What do you think?",
    "I think you should be reported to child services!",
    "Mind your business, Lady.   This is a family matter.",
    "I can't do it. I don't have it in me.",
    "Hey, no sweat off my sack. Tell Alex to stop wearing underwear all together. He'll be fine. That's what I did.",
    "You're right! My kids need me.",
    "At'a boy. Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in 2008.",
    "Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas.",
    "There must be a very hot girl downstairs.",
    "There is.    What are you doing?",
    "I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it?",
    "Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow?",
    "I am so ready.",
    "That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son.",
    "Oh my god.     Was that-",
    "Did you see-",
    "I told you he was cute.",
    "So I've been here a couple days now and I think I got it figured out. You girls are lesbians, right?",
    "Mind if I sit here?",
    "Mark?    You look totally different.",
    "I got rid of the bull's eye on my forehead.",
    "Could you move to the left a little?",
    "Who's she?",
    "Nicole Lopez. She's in my Spanish class.",
    "Have you spoken to her?",
    "No. I get all stupid so I just stare.",
    "I'll tell you a funny story. The first time I met your mother I was so nervous-",
    "My mother?",
    "What?",
    "You said, `the first time I met your mother I was so nervous...'",
    "I did?    That's weird.   Is your mom hot?",
    "Dude.",
    "What's going on tonight?    You wanna hang out? Do something?",
    "Really?",
    "Yeah you could show me around.",
    "Cool.",
    "I'll swing by your house around 7.",
    "I wouldn't go over there. Stan and his Baboons have lunch this period.",
    "Don't worry. I'll see you tonight.",
    "Did you girls catch Ellen yesterday? Rosie was on. Melissa Etheridge jammed-",
    "-You're so rude!? We're not gay. We like boys.",
    "Yeah, Samantha's a total slu...",
    "Last New Year's Samantha made it with my boyfriend.",
    "I was on like 5 Red Bulls! I can't believe you keep bringing that up.",
    "Rad phone.",
    "I know. I'll text you...NOT. Later...much.",
    "Like we'd ever give you our numbers.",
    "Heads up!",
    "Stan. Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name?",
    "You think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are?",
    "Cut it out, Stan.    Let's eat.",
    "Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch.",
    "You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.",
    "You don't know me.",
    "Oh but I do. All too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team. Dates the pretty girls. High school is your kingdom.",
    "But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason-",
    "I'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3.",
    "Don't hurt yourself big boy.",
    "3, 2, 1...",
    "My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know I'm not planning on going to college.",
    "A lot of kids feel that way. Don't be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to take a look.",
    "A good place to start is here... this book has information on every college and university in the country.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Hello?",
    "It was incredible! I was incredible! You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers!",
    "See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office?",
    "Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy.",
    "Coming!",
    "I've been dying to meet you. I've",
    "Is something wrong?",
    "No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please.",
    "And you say Ed Freedman is your father?",
    "That's my dad. All 68 inches of him.",
    "You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother?",
    "My mother...she...she was...a...",
    "-a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now.",
    "Oh?   I'm sorry.",
    "I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe?",
    "Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that?",
    "I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town.",
    "I'll keep that in mind, Mark.",
    "It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager.",
    "You doing some gardening?",
    "I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you.",
    "It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some.",
    "I almost don't even recognize it...er...if I had seen it before I probably wouldn't recognize it.",
    "You wouldn't have. It was a disaster back here a few days ago. Obviously I have a lot to do still. I'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here.",
    "Then I'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants. I have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there.",
    "And I'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one. It'll be a real sanctuary back here.",
    "It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar.",
    "My husband's the only one that ever calls me that.",
    "Yo, Mark.    Let's do this.",
    "Good luck with the project.",
    "Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be home by 10:30.",
    "How's your mom doing? You know, with your dad not being around and all.",
    "She doesn't like to show it but I know she's bummed. I think it bothers her more that he hasn't called me or Maggie in a while. Whatever.",
    "Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but w/e. brb. bk. gtg. ttyl. xo. sam.",
    "I have no idea what this says?",
    "It says `What up? Mobbing it to Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be right back. Back. Got to go. Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam.",
    "Let's hit the beach, wingman.",
    "We were on his myspace page. There's a picture of him jamming with the Chili Peppers at Coachella.",
    "I heard Timbaland wants to produce an album with him.",
    "Yeah, but he turned him down to help orphans with Brangelina in Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa.",
    "Oh my God!     I bet he knows Justin.",
    "This looks boring. Let's go back to my house and play video games.",
    "What are you so nervous about?",
    "The beach is for the older, cool kids. I don't belong here.",
    "What are you talking about? You're a basketball player. You're cool.",
    "I don't play basketball. I mean, I can play, I just don't play on the team.",
    "But I thought you were getting ready for the season?",
    "I never told you that.",
    "Here he comes!",
    "Can he be any lamer? Using my little brother to get to me?",
    "If that boy was an apple he'd be delicious.",
    "Oh, man.   It's her.   She's here.",
    "Who?",
    "She's so pretty it makes me gassy.",
    "Calm down. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna go over there and introduce yourself-",
    "She won't like me, Mark.   I'm a loser.",
    "Why? Because Stan says so? You think Stan's a winner? He's going nowhere. You're a great kid. Any girl would be lucky to get your attention.",
    "Really?",
    "Really. And right now, there's a girl over there who's dying to meet you.",
    "Okay.   What do I say?",
    "Just introduce yourself. Then compliment her on something she never gets complimented on. Like if she has big, meaty, man hands tell her she should be a hand model. And don't burp on her.",
    "I can do that.",
    "You came! Why don't we take a walk somewhere private and play?",
    "I don't think so, Sam. Mark promised me a walk on the beach.",
    "Walk with me. I've got less miles on me.",
    "Hi.",
    "Hi, Alex.     I'm Nicole.",
    "You don't look like a Nicole.",
    "You have big, meaty man hands.    You should be a hand model.",
    "Oh my God!     Seriously!?",
    "Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real nervous and I've wanted to talk to you for so long. And Mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but I couldn't find anything because everything's so...perfect.",
    "Do you want to sit down, Nicole?",
    "What do you want?",
    "Stan.   Why are you dating him?",
    "Get to the point why don't you?",
    "I'm serious. He's not a nice guy. Matter of fact he's a jackass.",
    "Don't talk about him like that. You don't even know him.",
    "I know he bullies your brother.",
    "Stan barely knows Alex exists. We're moving in together after graduation.",
    "Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you were going to Georgetown?",
    "I'm going to Westwood Community College. Stan and I both are.",
    "The hell you are, Young Lady! If you think I'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy! I forbid you to see him anymore and that's final!",
    "Who do you think you are!?   My father?!",
    "Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!",
    "Who's Margaret?",
    "He doesn't even know her name.",
    "He's so not into her.",
    "I haven't heard from him in three weeks. Obviously he doesn't care.",
    "He cares.",
    "Then where is he?",
    "What's going on?",
    "Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping something off.",
    "Our court date is the 27th. If he has anything to say, he can say it then.",
    "What was that all about?",
    "That envelope contains divorce papers.",
    "But what do you care? You're going to college, right? Life's one big panty raid for you.",
    "I don't know what you're talking about?",
    "I saw the applications in your room.",
    "You went through my room!?",
    "If you'd cleaned like I asked I wouldn't have had to. You can't be serious about this can you?",
    "I have to face the possibility that I might never turn back and if that's the case, I'm going to do it right this time around.",
    "Karmically speaking, in the next life you're coming back as a hemorrhoid.",
    "I'm not paying for college!",
    "You like her, don't you?",
    "Who?",
    "My girlfriend. She told me you were trashing me at the beach.",
    "Leave her alone, Stan.    She's a good kid.",
    "I don't know how good she is yet but after I find out, she's all yours.",
    "Settle, people.",
    "This was your homework. Who can come up here and solve this for me? Anyone?",
    "Not one person. Fine. Miss O'Donnell. Come up here and dazzle us with your brilliance.",
    "Stuck!!!   I'm stuck!   My fingers!",
    "Sit down, Stan! Sit down!",
    "It's glue! I'm glued to everything!",
    "I'll get it off!",
    "No!    No!   Don't pull--!",
    "I got your text.     What's so important?",
    "This year you're making the team. We practice everyday `til try outs. That gives us a week and a half.",
    "Forget it.",
    "Yeah, you're right. You probably don't have any skills anyway.",
    "Hey!     I got skills.",
    "So what's your problem?      Is it Stan and his friends?",
    "Just leave it alone.",
    "You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex.",
    "I'm too small anyway.",
    "That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot. Remember, it's not how big you are-",
    "-it's how big you play. Where did you hear that?",
    "I don't know? Read it somewhere I guess. Be a sport. Show me what you got.",
    "Alright.   You got a little game.",
    "What are you 2 queers doing in my gym?",
    "Let's go, Alex.",
    "I don't think so. You girls wanna play with the boys then let's play. 2 on 2.",
    "We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs.",
    "Come on, Ally. Embarrass me.",
    "Back off, Stan.",
    "It's okay.     I got him.",
    "You ready?     Here it comes.",
    "2 points!     And I was fouled!",
    "Hey! That's enough! That's enough!",
    "My mom's been in there a while. She's gonna be pissed.",
    "Act like you're hurt and she won't be able to stay mad at you.",
    "Way to go, slugger! Get any shots in?",
    "Mr. Freedman, your son has a black eye.",
    "Wuss!",
    "Hey, Alex.     How you doin', buddy?",
    "I'm okay I guess.",
    "Good. Good. Nice goin'. How do I look? Anything in my teeth? How's my breath?",
    "Ed.",
    "Hey, Scarlet. Exciting, isn't it? My first parent/principal conference.",
    "Fighting?     What's gotten into you?",
    "I can't talk, Mom.     My jaw.",
    "My poor baby. And how about you, Mark?",
    "Ouch.   You poor thing. Does it hurt?",
    "Not anymore. You smell great.",
    "Alex, I'll meet you at the car.     I need to talk to Uncle Ed for a second.",
    "Did you give him the divorce papers?",
    "I sent them to him.",
    "Is it another woman? I can handle it. Tell me the truth.",
    "I haven't heard from him, really.",
    "Okay. If you do, please have him call home. For the kids...I'm running out of excuses-",
    "I'll tell him.    I promise.",
    "Ed, come on in.",
    "I'll take it from here.",
    "I'm heartbroken. The boy's incorrigible.",
    "Look, if it was only one isolated fight it wouldn't distress me all that much. Boys will be boys. But, it's also been brought to my attention that Mark may have Krazy glued a boy to his chair.",
    "My son?     Mark!   Get in here!   Now!",
    "Did you glue a boy to his chair?",
    "No.",
    "See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables-",
    "Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to be the new kid but if I have anymore trouble from you, you'll be facing detentions or worse. You can go now.",
    "He's crying out for help and I don't know what to do. It hurts so bad. Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas?",
    "Let's give him time to figure it out on his own. If the situation gets worse then we'll take the next step.",
    "You're the expert. I'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind.",
    "Got an extra pair of gloves?",
    "Gloves are for sissies.",
    "Yeah, but I just had a manicure.",
    "You're serious? You want to help?",
    "Are you kidding? I love landscaping!",
    "It's right up there with watching \"Sex and the City\" and snuggling.",
    "Mark, I'm 36 years old-",
    "I'm just doing this to make a few bucks so I can buy Laker tickets.",
    "Embarrassing. Sorry.      I'll give you 10 dollars a day.",
    "Wow. 10 whole dollars. At that rate I should be able to buy tickets in...2011.",
    "Fine.   20.     Grab a roll.",
    "What are the benefits like here?",
    "I'll throw in a baloney sandwich.",
    "Deal.",
    "Maggie?",
    "What do you want? To rub it in my face? Say I told you so?",
    "You lost me?",
    "Stan dumped me.",
    "What happened? What did he do? You didn't...",
    "My mom was working last night. Stan came over with a box of-",
    "Your next word better be `cookies' or you're in big, big trouble!",
    "What am I going to do?    I can't live without him.",
    "Maggie, did you two...you know...do...",
    "Do what?",
    "That thing...that rabbits do a lot of and that a girl your age should never do and should only do when she's married.",
    "Sex?   No, that's why he dumped me!",
    "There, there now.       It's okay.",
    "Sure he was a jerk but he was there for me. Which is more than I can say for any other man in my life.",
    "When you're young everything seems like the end of the world. But it's not. It's just the beginning. And you might have to meet a few more jerks, but one day you'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated...like the sun rises and sets with you.",
    "You really think so?",
    "I know so.",
    "You're so sweet.",
    "That makes 11-3. Game over. Gather up.",
    "You've gotta little bit of your old man in you, O'Donnell.",
    "As you all know due to the amount of seniors coming back I only have 2 open spots on the roster. It's Freedman and O'Donnell. The rest of you hit the showers.",
    "Wooo!   We did it, Mark!    We did it!",
    "You killed it out there!",
    "Son, I don't know where you came from but you just made my year.",
    "Mom!    Mom!",
    "I'll be right out, Honey!",
    "I got'a use the bathroom.",
    "Mark? I didn't know you were there.",
    "I'm sorry.     You just look so beautiful.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Can I zip you up?",
    "I'm wearing a sweater.",
    "Your jeans?",
    "Stupid, idiot, stupid.",
    "Maggie, what...",
    "Shhh. I get it now. Why you didn't want me to be with Stan, the nice things you said in the library. It's because you wanted me.",
    "Maggie, listen to me.    I'm not the person you think...",
    "Shhh. Yes, you are. You're a good guy. You're not like the others.",
    "That's right! I'm not like the others. I'm very different than the others. So different that you and I can never be...",
    "What are you trying to say?    Are you...\"confused\"?",
    "Yes! Yes! That's it. I'm confused. Extremely confused.",
    "Ohmygod! It all makes sense now! Your hair. The highlights.",
    "What? No-no-no-no. I'm not gay. I'm...I've been in love with the same girl since I was 17.",
    "Who is it? Does she go to our school? Do I know her?",
    "No, you don't. Now- -if you don't mind?",
    "Tell your girlfriend she better keep a close eye on you.",
    "Who you texting?",
    "My dad.   I have to tell him about today.",
    "Did you just get a text?",
    "Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll just call him back.",
    "So?   What happened? Tell me.     Tell me.   I'm dying to hear.",
    "I did it. I'm a Falcon!     The first game's in 2 weeks.",
    "Oh my God, Alex! That's so incredible!",
    "I'm so happy for you. And now I want to show you guys something.",
    "Ta da!",
    "You hung the lights!",
    "I wanted you to be the first to see it.",
    "Mom, it's sick.",
    "It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm sorry I never saw how talented you are...I mean when people see this and how talented you are you'll be designing sanctuaries all over the city.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Mom, why are you all dressed up?",
    "Oh my God. I almost forgot.    I have a date.",
    "Let's see who the lucky guy is.",
    "I knew it!",
    "I knew you had a thing for him! You can't do this! You took vows. What kind of example are you setting for the kids!?",
    "Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But I'm too old for you.",
    "Wow. You look absolutely ravishing.",
    "Keep it in your pants, Casanova.",
    "Don't mind him. You all set?",
    "Let's do it.",
    "Hey, kid...if the vans'a rockin'...well you know the rest.",
    "Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live!",
    "It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad.",
    "It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats.   You need to talk to her.",
    "My mom's been pretty sad the past few months. She deserves to be happy. My dad obviously is...wherever he is.",
    "Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be.",
    "No, my dad's not a family guy. This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he'd never make it to a game.",
    "Then why would you tell him that?",
    "I guess I was hoping it would make him like me more.",
    "My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed.",
    "What about college?",
    "I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family back. You're not gonna wear that, are you?",
    "Baby's got back.",
    "Now that Julie's agreed to go out with me tonight, I need you to start behaving. I can't have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate.",
    "Fine. I want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate Alex making the team. Is that cool?",
    "Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I remember hearing what those parties were like, kids peeing everywhere, food on the ceilings, puke in the pool.",
    "Listen to you. You sound like an old man.",
    "No party. I mean it.    Don't make me take the car away.",
    "Don't treat me like a child, Ed.",
    "I won't when you stop acting like one.",
    "Sir!   Please!",
    "This isn't over...son!",
    "Not even close...Dad!",
    "Party at my house 2nite.   7.    Get the word out.",
    "Give me that!",
    "Hey, Sexy.",
    "I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex?",
    "Dance with us!",
    "Nambib-bib-ib, that African country makes me horny.",
    "Perfect, aren't they?",
    "Which one of us is it gonna be?",
    "I thought you girls wanted to dance?",
    "I was upset. I'm sorry. But I need you to show me you love me. Then we'll move in together.",
    "Whatever.    I'm with someone else now.",
    "Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid enough?",
    "Him.",
    "Party's over, Stan.      You're out of here.",
    "Who's gonna make me leave?      You?",
    "I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it.",
    "You can have the nun.      She doesn't put out anyway.",
    "On second thought-",
    "There you are, Mr. Freedman.",
    "Thanks. Put this towards your studies.",
    "When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Ed.",
    "Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am?",
    "As long as we're on the same page.",
    "Good evening. Would you care to see the wine-",
    "Bring us the 1962 Petrus.",
    "You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle.",
    "I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark?",
    "It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?",
    "You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you?",
    "Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.",
    "You're disgusting, Ed.",
    "What? You don't like Beluga?     You can get something else.",
    "I'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine.",
    "Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo?",
    "I came here because I'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark. All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are.",
    "I do care about Mike...Mark. Whatever his name is.",
    "You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet.",
    "But you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems. Instead it made you just like them. I have to go.",
    "Wait. You're right. I'm acting like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please stay.",
    "Act normal or I'm leaving.",
    "I had the craziest dream. I was 17 again and back in high school. It was horrible, Scarlet-",
    "Scarlet!?",
    "You wanna play? Okay, let's play. I'm the hungry lioness and you're a baby gazelle.",
    "Wait! This is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional. Listen to me, Maggie. I'm your father.",
    "And I've been a bad, bad girl, Daddy.",
    "How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time she rolls her r's she spits all over me.",
    "Mike, I blew it!     I totally blew it!",
    "Blew what?     What happened?",
    "She wanted me to kiss her but I panicked. I didn't know if I should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue I'm supposed to use-",
    "Slow down. Have you ever kissed a girl before?",
    "Not a real one. I used to practice on my dad's Playboys.",
    "How did you find...forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like THIS-",
    "-hold her still as you adjust your head, close your eyes and kiss her. The rest happens naturally.",
    "That is so wrong.",
    "What if I, you know, pitch a tent?",
    "If you feel it, you know, getting angry, take a step back. Now go get that kiss.",
    "Nicole.",
    "I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-",
    "911.   ^stairs. mastr b-room.",
    "We decided not to make you choose.",
    "You can have all 3 of us.",
    "Girls, if I was 20 years younger I'd...probably only last 10 seconds anyway. Put your clothes back on.",
    "Was he crying?",
    "God's honest truth. I had the whole costume. I used to go everywhere dressed like a wizard. No wonder I didn't get a date all through high school. Annnnd you think I'm the biggest nerd ever.",
    "No, no, really. I don't. Hark! Who goes there?",
    "Tis I. The Wizard they call Marius. And who might you be fair maiden?",
    "Tis I! Elf Princess Ariala of Jamroar.",
    "Check please!",
    "I'm so dead.",
    "Oh no!",
    "Scarlet, what are you doing here?",
    "I'm looking for Alex. It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone. Is he here?",
    "Yeah, he's fine.   He's with his girlfriend.",
    "Alex has a girlfriend?",
    "He does and she's really cute. Come on.",
    "How did you get your hands on the 5th edition? That's not due out for another three years.",
    "I have two words for you.    Russian mafia.",
    "Drive faster.",
    "Calm thyself, Marius.",
    "That little-!   I'll kill him!",
    "It's Ms. Goodwin!    Run!",
    "Everybody out!   Get out!   Get out!",
    "This party is over! If you don't want to spend the next 3 months in detention you will leave...now!",
    "Do you know where Mark Freedman is?",
    "I think I saw him go outside.",
    "Have you seen Mark?",
    "We're looking for him too.",
    "He's like a totally different person.",
    "It's been so good for him to have you around. You have no idea.",
    "Believe me, I do. He's a great kid. And you're an amazing mother.",
    "I'm not so sure. I mean look at me. I showed up at a party to drag my son home. Could I be any more embarrassing? And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off?",
    "Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't blame yourself for his stupidity.",
    "I knew he was unhappy. I knew he hated his job. I should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. He gave up a lot for me.",
    "That's bull shit! You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me...him. He was just too selfish to recognize it. At least, that's how I see it.",
    "He's over there.    By the pool.",
    "Who's the ho?",
    "Mom?",
    "Whoa.   What's my mom doing here?",
    "You're sweet. I have no idea why I'm telling you all this. There's just something so familiar...",
    "What do you think you're doing!?",
    "Scar, just calm down. I have something to tell you but I need you to keep an open mind. Can you do that for me?",
    "This conversation is over, Mark.",
    "I'm not Mark.",
    "I'm not in the mood for games.",
    "It's no game. I'm me...him...Mike. It's me...your husband.",
    "What?   Why would you say that?",
    "It's the truth. I'm the father of your children. You have to believe me.",
    "Don't ever come near me or my family again. If you do, I'll have you arrested or better yet, institutionalized.",
    "Let me explain, Scar.",
    "Your son needs a shrink!",
    "Pervert!",
    "Alex, wait. Let me explain-",
    "How could you do this to me?",
    "This place is a disaster! A kid pissed all over my English garden! What were you thinking!?",
    "She hates me, Ed.    I've ruined everything.",
    "Who hates him? What's going on?",
    "Oh boy. I don't quite know how to put this.",
    "Try being honest.",
    "He's not really my son.    I don't have a son.",
    "Mark's obviously having a crisis and you...you insensitive bastard, you disown him? He'd be better off with his mother in Thailand.",
    "Should I call you?!",
    "Come on.   It's been 2 days.    Open up.",
    "Jesus. It smells like Jeffrey Dahmer's kitchen in here.",
    "Are you alright?",
    "I really messed up.    I've lost my family.",
    "That's not true.      Nothing's ever truly lost.",
    "What about you and Julie?",
    "Oh, that?    That's lost.",
    "Sorry about the party.      I'll pay for any damages.",
    "Don't worry about it. My spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so we're good. I don't mean to rub salt in your wounds but-",
    "-you're due in court in an hour.",
    "-the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?",
    "I do.",
    "You've requested a divorce by the State of California citing irreconcilable differences. Is this correct?",
    "Yes, your Honor.",
    "Is Michael O'Donnell or his representative present?",
    "No, your Honor.",
    "Then I take his absence as agreement to the orders of the divorce. Let's proceed. You're not asking for alimony or child support?",
    "No, your honor.",
    "What exactly are we doing?",
    "I don't know. We just need to stop her from going through with it!",
    "A well thought out plan.   Good job.",
    "The mother will have full custody of the children. The father will have visitation rights of one weekend a month-",
    "I declare a mistrial on the grounds of insufficient evidence and Sacco and Vanzetti!",
    "Sacco and...what are you....who are you!?",
    "I am legal counsel for Mike O'Donnell and I demand a stay of execution for this marriage, your Majesty.",
    "He's my husband's best friend.",
    "Are you a lawyer, best friend?",
    "No but I have been a defendant in numerous lawsuits so-",
    "Bailiff! Get these 2 out of my courtroom.",
    "Your Honor! I have a letter from Mike O'Donnell. Just let me read it. Please.",
    "I'm sorry, but-",
    "If it's okay, your Honor.   I'd like to hear it.",
    "Make it quick.",
    "Thank you, your Honor. September 7th, 1988 was the first time I saw you. You were reading `The Great Gatsby' and wearing a Guns N Roses T-shirt. I'd never seen anything so perfect. I remember thinking I had to have you or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year-old kid can have. You whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and I felt so peaceful and safe because I knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because I had you. And then I grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. But I was never lost. I'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. And I never failed at anything because on that September day you said `yes' to me. And at that dance you said you loved me. And as I stand here...as I write this, I want you to know if I don't have you I'll die...not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have....oh and...P.S...I'm `Hungry Like the Wolf'.",
    "Alright, son, you have to go now.",
    "Let's proceed.",
    "Your Honor, Sir. I'm sorry.   I'm in no shape...I need to postpone...I'm sorry.",
    "Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back. That speech should've broken the spell.",
    "Enough with the magic crap, Ed.",
    "You know what this means? You need to let them go. You need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours.",
    "Where you going?",
    "I'm moving on. See you at the game.",
    "Hey, Freedman, save some for the game.",
    "Just warming up, Coach.",
    "Son, I haven't seen anyone with your shooting ability in, well, in a long time. I called a couple college scouts I know. They're coming to the game tonight...to watch you. If you have half the season I think you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want.",
    "That's the plan, Coach.",
    "Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time.",
    "3, 2, 1-",
    "I thought he was hanging out with Alex to get to me- not you.",
    "Alright, Ladies, bring it in!",
    "ALEX-",
    "I have nothing to say to you.",
    "I never meant to hurt you-",
    "Then why'd you kiss my mom!?",
    "Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know. I'm sorry.",
    "You're lucky I don't punch you out.",
    "Julie, can I talk to you?",
    "What is it, Ed?",
    "I've seen a good friend of mine lose everything that means anything to him. And maybe we'll never be there but...I just really want to play D & D with you.",
    "You can raid my dungeon anytime.",
    "I'll bring my long bow.",
    "Let's go! Remember, Boys, winners get the girls. Losers please themselves!",
    "Son! Come back here!      You're gonna get a delay of game!",
    "This can't be happening again.",
    "It's your turn now.    Good luck.",
    "Get off your butt, O'Donnell!    Get in there!"
